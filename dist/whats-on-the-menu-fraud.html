										Cybercrime is the new black - is the food sector an
										exception?
									</li>
								</ol>
							</strong>
							<p>
								In an everchanging world, financial crime has been keeping up
								with the new ways of working. Technology has allowed for a
								larger geographic reach than before, and new types of crimes
								are emerging. During COVID-19, the different types of crimes
								evolved. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as an
								inter-governmental body which operates as a global money
								laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, have stated that
								cybercrime, in particular, has flourished during the pandemic.
								Malicious actors took advantage of these opportune conditions
								to exploit vulnerabilities in existing controls, or to bypass
								them completely. For example, when people work from home, the
								controls designed for the traditional office environment are
								not necessarily sufficient. Compliance professionals should
								scrutinize whether there are adequate controls in place to
								protect their staff and company from malicious cyber-attacks
								on their systems and procedures.
							</p>
							<p>
								As new business-models develop, new types of attempts appear
								to maliciously benefit from them. Let's take an interesting
								example: gig-job economy. In the past few years, the gig
								economy has been growing tremendously, causing the rise of
								different types of scams in this industry sector. When you
								think about fraud, you generally think of embezzlement or
								other types of activities, which takes place in the financial
								sector. Gig economies have seen a rise in the number of
								potentially suspicious activities. For example, in the food
								delivery industry, where the pressure to ensure customer
								satisfaction and fast deliveries is high, the transactions can
								be subject to a lesser scrutiny and customer complaints are
								handled fast. As the average orders are also quite low in
								value, traditional triggers can potentially miss red flags and
								make the food delivery industry a tempting area for criminals
								to pursue.
							</p>
							<p>
								The different ways of benefiting from the food delivery
								services can range from customer account takeovers and sale of
								customer accounts on the dark web to drug dealers using food
								delivery services to transport drugs during COVID-19
								lockdowns. Interpol discovered that many countries now report
								an increasing number of cases where criminals used delivery
								networks, or pretended to be part of food delivery networks to
								deliver drugs and other illicit items hidden in delivery
								boxes.
							</p>
							<p>
								The emerging new risks in this sector shows how much a robust
								compliance program can help to protect the companies, their
								customers and partners. What should a compliance officer in
								the food delivery sector do to prevent such behavior?
							</p>
							<strong>
								<ol start="2">
									<li class="pb-1 pt-1">Compliance in the food sector</li>
								</ol>
							</strong>
							<p>
								First of all, keep it simple - ensure that the basics are
								right. Although the service platforms differ from e.g. the
								financial sector to a great extent, certain things remain the
								same. Second, ensure sufficient due diligence process is on
								place about whom you operate with. This should extend not only
								to the customers of the service, but to the vendors, delivery
								companies and other partners. A sufficient due diligence
								process gives comfort in knowing whom we are working with, and
								what we are moving between the different parties. Knowing this
								will help you to build a steadier and more transparent model
								to track anomalies.
							</p>
							<p>
								Many companies use third party vendors for suspicious behavior
								tracking, others build inhouse models. The key in both
								operational models is to understand how you expect the
								customer (in its largest definition) to behave when using the
								platform and what to do you when you find anomalies. The
								employees of the service platform are the sharpest assets of a
								company in combatting financial crime. This is particularly
								true for the food delivery industry. When the staff is
								committed and hungry for success, it is easier to see
								potential red flags. This makes education and training an
								investment well worth it.
							</p>
							<p>
								How then to tackle the attempts of fraudsters and cyber
								criminals? It is hard to stay ahead of fraudsters, who
								constantly change their modus operandi and find new ways to
								exploit a platform or service provider. Yet, doing regular
								stress testing, scrutinizing the ins and outs of the controls
								and challenging the effectiveness are key actions to fight
								against the creativity of fraudsters. I also believe in
								exchange of experiences and developing best practices in the
								industry. Nobody wins if the fraudsters are not got caught -
								there is a strength in exchanging ideas and perspectives. This
								is one of the reasons why I think WEC is an excellent forum. A
								place where women from various industries can come together,
								exchange experiences and learn from each other in a safe
								environment make an impact on the financial crime sector, as
								well as any other field of compliance. It is refreshing to
								hear different experiences from people across the globe, some
								battling the same questions, others having similar situations
								but different ways of operating. It shows that with joining
								forces we can help each other to progress and make a
								long-lasting impact.

								<strong>What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger
									self?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Don't be so hard on yourself! perfectionism is not to be
								strived for. Be proud of your achievements and allow for the
								imperfection.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
									be doing now?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Hard to say, I've always wanted to be a lawyer since
								elementary school. I guess if not working in Compliance and
								Financial Crime, I'd find criminology and sociology quite
								fascinating!
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>At the end of your career, if you were to sit and reflect,
									what one hope do you have?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								That representation in companies look different than it still
								did in the 2020's. That the glass ceiling had been broken and
								that more women held board positions.
