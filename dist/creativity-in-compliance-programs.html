								Did you know that creativity fits into compliance? Why? Let's think together:
								adaptability, problem-solving, building trust, accountability, communication, and
								connection - they all take creativity.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is common to hear the question of “how to create an effective compliance program?”
								and the get the perfectly constructed 7 steps will come to your table as an answer. What
								nobody told you is that magical formulas do not exist. We are living in an era of
								increased regulations and renewed enforcement efforts, both for public and private
								companies. Equally, accountability in tangible and intangible assets are more and more
								important as the profits that the company generates. Consumers are looking for companies
								those offer something new and add aggregated value to their products and services.
							</p>
							<p>
								The question usually we hear nowadays from professionals is how to implement an
								effective compliance program? The answer usually is: it depends. Following established
								guidelines from other companies is always risky whether it is going to be effective in
								your company. There is no perfect answer for this question yet any compliance program
								providers would offer you the seemingly golden path based on these questions:
							<ol style="list-style-position: inside;">
								<li><em>What are your company needs?</em></li>
								<li><em>What are the true company's values?</em></li>
								<li><em>What do you want to achieve in medium and the long term?</em></li>
							</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
								A compliance program needs to understand thoroughly your business needs, take into
								account the maturity of your entity and, of course, it needs a piece of creativity.
								Understanding deeply the values of the company shapes the pillars that build the
								organization's compliance culture. In this new era industry where everyone is highly
								connected, compliance professionals shall be creative to grab the attention of their
								audience.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here are my advice how to create and implement an effective compliance program:
							</p>
							<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Speak up!</strong> Use an easy language and understandable for different
									stakeholders. Formality is necessary in determined situations but in an era
									where people watch no more than 15 seconds of TikTok dancing videos you shall do
									your best fanfic to not lose their attention. Internal communications are a must
									to have!
								</li>
								<li><strong>Operate by principles.</strong> People are more likely to recognize
									themselves in a situation when you touch them. Understanding the core values of
									the company will support you to link with common words that we use in compliance
									programs such as: Integrity, respect, ethics, and many others.</li>
								<li><strong>Straight to the point.</strong> Do you really need a policy with 100
									pages? In some situations, yes, in other situations you could create a design
									guideline or a Questions & Answer that will support the team to localize the
									principal bullet points of the program easily.</li>
								<li><strong>Open the channel!</strong> Embrace the feedback, listen to your
									audience, and open the channel for everyone. You have some answers, but you will
									only improve your program if you actively listen to everyone. From your point of
									view things might be making sense, but have you ever surveyed them?</li>
								<li><strong>Be humble. Be brave.</strong> The days of compliance professionals are
									not easy, be open minded to understand the other team's daily work. Put on their
									shoes and find out the best solution together. Procedures and policies are only
									words if not concrete applied.</li>
								<li><strong>Networking and design thinking.</strong> Understand the different types
									of practice of the market and design thinking with your team (not necessary
									compliance team!) to find out the best “users' experience” when people are
									handling your compliance program.</li>
							</ul>
							</p>

								<strong>What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger
									self?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								"So don't worry about whether you like your situation or not. Life doesn't give a damn
								about what you like. It's up to you to connect what you want with what you need to do to
								get it and then find the courage to carry it through." (from "Principles: Life and Work
								by Ray Dalio)
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
									be doing now?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I wouldn't have an alternative career. I'm exactly where I am supposed to be.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>At the end of your career, if you were to sit and reflect,
									what one hope do you have?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								That my job has positively impacted society somehow.
