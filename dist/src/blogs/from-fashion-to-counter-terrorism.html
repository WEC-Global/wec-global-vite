							Lucy Game is a final year International Relations (BA Hons)
							student at the University of Liverpool. She is also an
							Intelligence Analyst Intern and Extremism Team Editor at The
							Counterterrorism Group, as well as a volunteer with the charity
							Care4Calais. She has always had an interest in ethics and
							compliance; particularly, what causes someone to commit
							unethical behavior and what strategies can be adopted to prevent
							this. Coming from a family with a strong legal and policy
							background (her mother was a Senior Policy Advisor for the Civil
							Service) she has always had a clear picture of moral ‘rights’
							and ‘wrongs’ and the value created by advocating for these
							morals through everyday actions. This is what led her down the
							path of counterterrorism as well as my work in championing the
							rights of refugees and asylum seekers with Care4Calais.

								class="blogpost__article-image pb-2" />
							<p>
								My professional experience in ethics and compliance began with
								various intern placements, one within external buying at Kurt
								Geiger and one in Asset and Profit Protection at Burberry.
								This work introduced me to the legal and ethical side of the
								fashion industry, particularly counterfeiting, illicit
								financing, internal ethics, compliance investigations, and
								ethical sourcing. Before this, I was not aware - maybe I’d
								even go as far to say naive - of the vast behind-the-scenes
								legal and policy work that goes into major brands. At the same
								time as these internships, I was studying for my A-Level
								qualifications, which I undertook in Psychology, Sociology,
								and Politics. At the time of choosing these subjects, they
								were just those I thought seemed interesting, but after a few
								months of study, I realised they were the perfect fit for my
								interests and my strengths.
							</p>
							<p>
								Originally, I had aimed to study a Criminology degree but
								transferred programs to International Relations before the
								commencement of my studies. I believe what shifted my interest
								was a teacher I had for my A-Level Politics course. A tall,
								sharp, and assertive woman from South Africa with the richest
								life experience I had ever encountered and a strong
								take-no-prisoners attitude. From growing up in Apartheid
								Johannesburg, to reporting on the Rwandan Genocide as a
								Journalist before the age of 20, to travelling the world
								working in over 5 different countries and speaking as many -
								if not more - languages. I was amazed by her wisdom, borne as
								a product of her life experience, and always thought I would
								feel very accomplished if I had even achieved half of what she
								had in my own lifetime.
							</p>
							<p>
								I had grown up around and been raised by a plethora of strong
								and inspirational women; I am a child of a single mother who
								has a history in defense and weapons policy. I grew up
								watching in awe of how my mother balanced a career, raising
								two young children, and at one point being the primary
								caregiver for my terminally ill father. I have always felt
								there was an underappreciated magic about women, the drive and
								resilience held by many before and many to come to mark their
								place in this world and leave a positive impact on others in
								the process. Women have an incredible power to develop the
								world into a kinder, more moral, and more ethical place, and I
								believe this is what motivates me in my work.
							</p>
							<p>
								The work of counterterrorism, and international relations as a
								more general field, is innately tied to ethical practice. When
								I decided to go down the path of international relations and
								counterterrorism, I felt this was where I would be able to
								have the most significant impact on the lives of others around
								me. This area has allowed me to hone my skills and interests
								in the areas of geopolitics and global security that are most
								important to me. These include, advocating for legal
								provisions protecting the rights of minorities, considering a
								racialised and gendered perspective in all intelligence
								analysis, and working to promote ethical norms for the
								management of displaced persons and asylum seekers. I consider
								myself incredibly lucky to have been born in an economically
								and politically stable country, allowing me to receive a
								strong education and therefore feel there is a moral
								imperative to use this to help improve the lives of those less
								fortunate wherever possible.

								<strong>What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger
									self?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Worry less - stop being anxious about what you may or may not
								achieve and focus that energy into things that bring you joy.
								Find balance in your life and don’t put all your eggs in one
								basket.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
									be doing now?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Maybe something in fashion. I like how freeing fashion and
								makeup can be; it can be used as an expression of whatever you
								would like it to be, and send messages far and wide. Fashion
								knows no language and no boundaries.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>At the end of your career, if you were to sit and reflect,
									what one hope do you have?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I hope that I consider whatever I have accomplished a success.
								Success will be relative to me at that point in time, but for
								now, success means happiness, well-roundedness, balance, and
								internal peace. I hope I can feel that I have fulfilled my
								purpose and made the world, even just marginally, a better
								place.
