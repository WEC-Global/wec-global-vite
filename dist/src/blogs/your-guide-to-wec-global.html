										Women in Ethics & Compliance Global (WEC Global) began as a
										coming together of a group of women who had a common
										interest in ethics and compliance. Each of these women was
										at different stages of their career, from all over the world
										and with a different specialism or link to ethics and
										compliance.
									</p>
									<p>
										For our Chairwoman, Luciane Mallmann, WEC Global is about
										providing a unique space to host the brilliant and
										smart-minded women, or those that identify as women, in the
										ethics and compliance community so they can connect,
										inspire, learn and collaborate has been a huge driver in the
										creation of this group. With so many fields within the world
										of ethics and compliance, having somewhere to share
										knowledge and expertise has never been more important. And
										with new challenges coming our way every day, forming a
										group that advocates and helps shape the future with dynamic
										leadership fills a gap in this space.
									</p>
									<p>
										When our founding members discuss why they work in ethics
										and compliance there were clear messages that came out time
										and time again: “doing the right thing”, “helping others”
										and “making change” are clear drivers for all of us.
									</p>
									<div class="blog__featured">
										<span
											>WEC Global is about providing a unique space to host
											brilliant and smart-minded women.</span
										>
									</div>
									<p>
										Alex Harrington, Vice-Chair, captured our thoughts
										brilliantly. She believes “the passion of working within
										Ethics and Compliance comes because these are the areas in
										which the laws, rules and systems societies create can
										either become successful and have lasting impacts or fail
										and entrench problems. Without a strong ethical system and
										the ability to ensure that public and private actors comply
										with laws and rules, current and future generations will
										continue to suffer harm and be unable to meet the challenges
										they face in an inclusive way.”
									</p>
									<p>
										Ethics and compliance may seem broad. Anti-bribery &
										corruption, anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terror
										financing (CTF), audit, data protection, and privacy,
										environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG),
										ethics, governance and risk, human rights, law enforcement,
										legal, social citizenship, or responsibility are some areas
										where we see most of our members joining from. For Kate
										Marston, Board Secretary, this is what makes WEC Global so
										exciting and unique. She says, “Although the specialisms in
										ethics and compliance are wide-ranging, there are crossovers
										within them all. Having a network you can look to when you
										need it, across all these areas is a powerful thing. The
										opportunities we will have access to as part of this group
										are also incredible.”
									</p>
									<p>
										As well as the usual events and projects that come with any
										organization’s membership such as this, we will also be
										opening Mentoring/Mentorship programs. We want our members
										to have access to truly inspiring colleagues, friends, that
										will provide them with appropriate insight, support, and
										opportunities to expand their professional and personal
										competencies. Aaisha Mohamed Anees, Chief Technology
										Officer, explains “When I think of a compliance
										organization, I do not think of something exciting or
										dynamic. I believe WEC Global will change that.”
									</p>
									<p>
										WEC Global members can benefit from a variety of
										perspectives and insights, from taking the stage at events
										to featuring as guests in blogs. Members will even
										contribute to the group’s growth strategy. Everyone will be
										equally important and valued in the organization. We want to
										help advance the careers of women in the industry and will
										have learning opportunities or support and sharing of job
										opportunities.
									</p>
									<p>
										Natana Lanzarin, our Communications Officer, hopes “that WEC
										(Global) becomes a safe space for women to develop and grow
										professionally with the support of other women within the
										ethics and compliance field and it becomes a strong
										community based on friendship and respect.”
									</p>
									<div class="blog__featured">
										<span
											>What better way to hone your skills than practicing with
											your support network who share a strong desire to lift
											each other rather than hold each other back!</span
										>
									</div>
									<p>
										Of course, we recognize and value the men in ethics and
										compliance, and whilst our focus is on women, we welcome men
										to join us as Friends of WEC Global. After all, we want
										everyone to take part in changing the conversation. Gina
										Green, our Vice-Chair, sums up, “Let’s make the world a
										better place both in for work and personal environments. We
										all hope for a long prosperous healthy life, ethics, and
										compliance go hand in hand with making a world where we can
										thrive unitedly as the human race.”
									</p>
									<p>
										This is the beginning of our journey and we invite you to
										join us in shaping the future.
									</p>
									<p>
										We are the Women in Ethics & Compliance Global. Welcome!
