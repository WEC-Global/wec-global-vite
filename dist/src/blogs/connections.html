							<p>
								The last twelve months have seen a dramatic shift for us all
								in terms of what the working week looks like. Our professional
								and personal lives have seen a blurring of the lines as one
								becomes an extension of the other. Whilst some have stated
								they feel disenfranchised from their workplaces, others state
								they have actually had far more personal dealings with their
								colleagues than ever before.
							</p>
							<p>
								In something as simplistic as the shift to online working the
								impact has been huge. With far more emphasis being placed on
								the written word and without those 'water cooler' moments that
								many relied upon to forge those more informal contacts with
								our peers, we have had to reach out for new ways to connect.
								Perhaps however these new ways have created something far more
								authentic and far more profound?
							</p>
							<p>
								In the absence of chatting with colleagues before and after
								meetings we have had to connect on a more personal and more
								proactive level. Seeking each other out over WhatsApp, via
								social media, over phone calls to check in on one another and
								more importantly to check up on one another. Conversations
								have become more real, more authentic, as we let each other in
								and shared with one another how we were feeling. United in our
								sense of frustration, of fear and of the desire to connect
								with another, we let each other in in a way perhaps previously
								we had reserved for our families and close friends.
							</p>
							<p>
								Never has our mental health been so front and centre in focus
								to both ourselves and to our workplaces. In the absence of
								afterwork drinks and face to face networking events we have
								seen one to one mentoring and virtual mental health events
								offered with incredibly large take ups. Events which allow us
								to connect with one another at a far more emotional level
								whilst removing the after-work drinks culture that existed
								previously. The result being that the connection side of these
								events has become paramount as we reached out to one another
								from the privacy of our own homes and the dynamic shifted into
								something far more authentic, far more tangible. The results
								of these meetings and events have been clear to see.
							</p>
							<p>
								Think back on how many posts you have seen recently where
								people have commented on the connections they have made with
								others in this new and virtual world? Forged through our
								remote interactions, some having never met in real life, but
								those connections are real. They matter. They will last.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the absence of the 'face to face' connections somehow, we
								have replaced those interactions with 'heart to heart'
								connections instead and that has made all the difference.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>What one piece of advice would you give your younger
									self?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								To never be defined by your job. It took me moving halfway
								across the world to realise I was a person and not just a role
								profile and that actually I preferred the person I was to the
								role profile I had become. Don't be afraid to take a step back
								and look at the world from a different angle.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
									be doing now?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I would love to be a writer. In a small cottage, with a
								roaring fire and unlimited amounts of tea, on the Scottish
								coast.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>At the end of your career, if you were to sit and reflect,
									what one hope do you have?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								That I've helped as many people as possible to achieve their
								goals. In every role I've ever had what has made me happy is
								knowing I've helped someone else in getting where they wanted
								to go. Whether that is career development, personal
								development or just in emotional support or by being there to
								listen. Our people are our core. They are what matter most.
