								<p>
									This year’s World Press Freedom Day theme “Information as a
									Public Good” serves as a call to affirm the importance of
									cherishing information as a public good, and exploring what
									can be done in the production, distribution, and reception of
									content to strengthen journalism, and to advance transparency
									and empowerment while leaving no one behind. The theme is of
									urgent relevance to all countries across the world. It
									recognises the changing communications system that is
									impacting on our health, our human rights, democracies, and
									sustainable development.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was November 2019. Donald Trump had been president of
									America for almost three years, there’d been an explosion of
									what became known as Trumpism and a politics of
									disinformation.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the United Kingdom, the Brexit vote of 2016 had concluded
									that it was leaving the EU, and negotiations were in full
									flow. But the Brits were also in the midst of another General
									Election dogged by rows over disinformation too.
								</p>
								<p>
									My team and I had unexpectedly managed to secure an interview
									with the Conservative MP Michael Gove - he was on a visit to
									Scotland where we were based.
								</p>
								<p>
									We meticulously researched our interview questions, as we
									rarely had the opportunity to interview a UK Government
									minister. We understood the significance of those timed
									moments of access to someone in power and the responsibility
									we had to the public to ask the right questions, scrutinise
									government claims and help to inform.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then, the night before our interview, there was a televised
									debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn (the leader of
									the Labour Party at the time) where the Conservative Party had
									renamed their main media account on Twitter as “factcheckUK”.
								</p>
								<p>
									Although the Twitter handle remained as @CCHQPress, all other
									branding was changed to resemble an independent factchecking
									outlet, meaning it may not have been immediately apparent to
									an individual who saw the account’s tweets in their feed that
									it was a product of Conservative party HQ.
								</p>
								<p>
									We knew we had to alter our plans to make sure we could ask
									about this.
								</p>
								<p>
									Before we reached the farm, where our interview was to take
									place, we pulled over on the side of the road to briefly
									rehearse. We discussed camera angles and agreed that we should
									film the whole interview with both interviewer and interviewee
									in shot throughout. It was an accountability interview and we
									wanted to avoid any accusations that we had edited it in some
									way to our advantage – sadly an issue we have to take into
									consideration.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you are interested in watching the interview, I’ve linked
									it
									<a
										target="_blank"
										href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO2zT9-B2X4"
										class="external-link"
										>here</a
									>. Although at times it is uncomfortable to watch, it was a
									measured pursuit of the truth amid a fog of disinformation
									surrounding the general election and earlier the EU
									referendum.
								</p>
								<p>
									What is also important is that work like this is seen and has
									impact, otherwise it can become lost. In the end this
									interview was viewed and shared millions of times on social
									media, it was the subject of debate shows and newspaper
									columns. In the Radio Times, John Simpson declared it a
									“defining moment of the election”.
								</p>
								<p>
									The reason the interview had the impact it did at the time,
									was that it was an outlier. And given all we know now with
									Trumpism and disinformation, it shouldn’t have been.
								</p>
								<p>
									But the interview had far broader significance because it
									exposed an unethical culture and shone a light on alternative
									facts and resistance to scrutiny.
								</p>
								<p>
									Little did we know that a month on from this interview the
									world would plunge into a pandemic. A year where journalistic
									scrutiny was to play a huge role in some of the most data
									heavy and complicated issues of our time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Like journalists around the world, our role was to hold
									governments to account for the decisions being made.
								</p>
								<p>
									A year on and we are still in the claws of that pandemic. We
									look to India and the suffering there, where it was previously
									reported that politicians had made claims they’d “beaten the
									pandemic”.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are difficult years ahead, with the impact the pandemic
									has had around the world, the crisis engulfing India,
									investigations into alleged improper conduct by the UK Prime
									Minister, the increasing tension in Northern Ireland and the
									Climate Change conference (COP26) coming to Scotland in
									November – this is significant because it will be the first
									one to take place after the Paris Agreement measures take
									effect. The year ahead will be unrelenting for my team.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are of course, too many global situations to be able to
									list them all here and it will be the same for journalists
									like me, everywhere.
								</p>
								<p>
									Many people will inform themselves, but with the threat of
									fake news, propaganda, its important people find sources and
									journalists they trust to expose unethical practices - these
									journalists play such an important role in providing the
									scrutiny that exposes the truth.
								</p>
								<p>
									As Nelson Mandela said, “A critical, independent and
									investigative press is the lifeblood of any democracy”.
								</p>

									wrongdoing and hold those in power to account.
