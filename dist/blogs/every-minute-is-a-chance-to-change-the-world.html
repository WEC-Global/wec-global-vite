							Diana Madibekova is a Teaching Fellow and PhD Researcher working
							on a project on international business and global peace since
							October 2020. She received an Associate Fellow qualification
							from Higher Education Academy UK in June 2021. She completed the
							Legal and Compliance Academy at the Credit Suisse Wroclaw as
							well as she was working for 2 years as a Regional Compliance
							Officer in Warsaw, Poland. She volunteered for a number of
							international NGOs such as British Council, American Corner and
							UNICEF Kazakhstan. What she is most proud of both in her
							professional and personal life are the relationships she has
							built and maintained over the years. She believes that our bonds
							with those around us make our lives more fulfilling and
							meaningful, therefore it is important to understand how
							relationships commence, continue, are cultivated and come to an
							end in a sustainable and healthy way, however itâ€™s equally vital
							to remember that the most crucial relationship we will ever have
							is the one with ourselves. Outside her formal functions, Diana
							is a guest speaker on panels and projects relating to
							empowerment of girls and women, peace, public good and better
							society.

								<strong>University years and compliance experience</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								In May 2014, I was attending Seoul National University as an
								international law exchange student, which is the alma mater of
								the former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I
								completed my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in
								international law in Kazakhstan and Poland and completed an
								internship at the Spanish Embassy in Kazakhstan in 2016. As an
								intern, I was contributing to reports, media monitoring,
								management of consular documentation, assisting in organizing
								cultural events, business forums, official visits between two
								capitals; preparing diplomatic correspondence such as
								ceremonial communications and <em>note verbale</em>. In 2017,
								I became a trainee at the International Office of the
								University of Wroclaw where I was advising on matters relating
								to visas, permits and health insurance contracts for students.
								I first got in touch with compliance during my internship in a
								Swiss bank between 2017 and 2018. It was a completely new
								world for me as I had no outstanding knowledge about banking
								and excel spreadsheets, which later I learnt that the world of
								finance (and compliance too) is not all about equations but
								also emotions. Therefore, it connects back to my earlier
								remark about the importance of human relationships and
								dialogue; it is vital for young people starting their career
								to cultivate meaningful bonds with their bosses, mentors and
								peers. My familiarity with the field of compliance got richer
								while I was working at a firm in Poland as a Regional
								Compliance Officer covering the Eastern European Marketsâ€™
								regulatory risk. I was in charge of managing internal and
								external stakeholders, communications with regulators and
								government authorities, ensuring that the relevant compliance
								programs are in place. As part of that job, I used to go on
								business trips, but since March last year it as all on pause.
								In May 2020, I read a Financial Times article that published
								readersâ€™ opinion on daily routines on hold due to Covid and
								was positively surprised to see my own brief remark about how
								we all miss a sense of security and safety.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>From compliance to academia</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								In September 2020, I started my PhD on business and peace
								under the supervision of excellent professors in a country
								which populated my childhood, England, where my global career
								aspirations commenced during the summer of 2010 at Haileybury
								College in Hertford. My current work focuses on understanding
								how companies contribute to create peaceful societies and thus
								lessen conflict and tension in countries where they operate.
								It remains critical for theoretical, practical and policy
								implications the way companies uphold compliance standards
								through their operations locally and globally.
							</p>
							<p>
								My career trajectory was greatly influenced by my teenage
								years while I was working part-time for different
								organisations such as the British Council, and American
								Corner, an umbrella program within the United States
								Department of State and met several interesting people. I was
								taking up on volunteering duties in childrenâ€™s rights
								department at UNICEF Kazakhstan in 2013 where I could meet
								with charge dâ€™affaires to foreign ministers and heads of
								international organizations. In 2014, I got to meet Roberto
								Azevedo, who was the-then Director General of World Trade
								Organisation at a distinguished lecture series at Seoul
								National University, and the-then German Foreign Minister
								Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his visit to Kazakhstan at the
								National Library. One of the most recent conferences I
								attended I could meet the first woman in history who was in
								the office of the United States Secretary of State Madeleine
								Albright at University of Warsaw in March 2019. Throughout the
								years from my early teenagehood and until now, I have learnt
								about the complex dynamics of human relationships, how
								emotions tend to manage us and why it is better if we manage
								them.
							</p>
							<p>
								My current academic work also examines the concept of peace as
								an effective emotion management. In my view, peace is not the
								expectation of being nice all the time. Peace is, regardless
								of conflict and collision, being able to build or reset a
								dialogue, despite the differences that drift people apart. It
								is a skill of learning to reach a goal while not always
								declaring oneself as a winner.
							</p>
							<p>
								My hope is that with my academic work and strength to connect
								with people, I am able to contribute to the betterment of the
								world where people opt for dialogue instead of division and
								where we are all seen for who we really are and not just what
								we come to represent.
