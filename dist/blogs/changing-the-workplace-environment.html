									<strong>What does ethics mean to you?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Ethics is based on general standards of right and wrong that
									prescribe what one should do, typically in terms of rights,
									obligations, benefits to society, or specific virtues. For me,
									I keep it simple and describe ethics as doing the right thing.
									I act ethically by living by a personal credo based on
									integrity, honesty, accountability, fairness, and respect.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What does Pride Month mean to you?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Pride Month means a lot to me. I take this time to make sure I
									am visible as a member of the LGBTQI community in my personal
									and professional life and on my social media platforms. The
									rainbow flag and my pronouns are displayed with pride
									year-round.
								</p>
								<p>
									It's a time to remember that a riot started this movement. On
									that historic night at the Stonewall Inn on June 28, 1969,
									LGBTQI folx had enough of police brutality, and a revolution
									was born. We have come a long way, but there is still so much
									more to go, even in our own community. We must continue the
									hard work so that our Black, Latinx, Trans, the disabled, and
									other marginalized groups within the LGBTQI community feel
									supported, heard, and valued.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>Which international issues affecting the global LGBTQI+
										community are particularly on your mind?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									A lot of progress has been made to secure protections for the
									LGBTQI community globally. But still, around eighty countries
									continue to criminalize us, with penalties including the death
									penalty. Moreover, across the globe, abuse and murder of
									LGBTQI individuals are often ignored and can be perpetrated by
									police, gangs, and even family members.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mainly on my mind are the LGBTQI people in Central America who
									face high levels of violence, have limited protections under
									national law, and have fled home in significant numbers in
									recent years, undertaking perilous journeys to seek asylum in
									the United States. I believe the US government should
									vigorously protect these asylum seekers' abilities to safely
									cross the border into the United States and apply for asylum.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>What do you think people can do this Pride Month to raise
										awareness about important issues that impact the global
										LGBTQI+ community?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									I think there is a lot one can do this Pride Month to raise
									awareness, but first and foremost, it's vital to have a voice
									and visibility. Marching and attending demonstrations or
									protests, showing up at community events, and speaking out on
									social media platforms is a great way to discuss important
									issues that impact the global LGBTQI community. It's also
									vital to take some time to learn more about international
									organizations in the fight to end LGBTQI discrimination and
									consider how you might support their work. Get involved or
									donate to groups such as
									<a
										target="_blank"
										href="https://ilga.org/donate"
										class="external-link"
										>ILGA</a
									>,
									<a
										target="_blank"
										href="http://www.lgbt-fan.org/action/donate/"
										class="external-link"
										>LGBT Freedom Asylum Network</a
									>, and
									<a
										target="_blank"
										href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/donate/"
										class="external-link"
										>Amnesty International</a
									>, to name a few.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>What are some strategies companies can follow to promote
										positive and welcoming environment for colleagues who are
										LGBTQI+?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									Pride Month is a great time to promote employee resource
									groups as they provide a safe space for employees to affirm
									their identities and empower staff to share their perspectives
									with the organization. Within these spaces, like-minded
									individuals can exchange ideas and advice, share resources,
									and show solidarity.
								</p>
								<p>
									Employee resources are a way to ensure that the needs of all
									team members are addressed. However, if your organization is
									too small to host robust employee resource groups, you can
									point staff to industry or community organizations.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>What's a question you never get asked that you'd love to
										answer?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									"Would you like a larger budget?" To which I would respond,
									"Of course"! But all kidding aside, I think if I were given a
									blank check, I would be very judicious about my budget,
									investing in emerging training platforms and more professional
									development for the team. For example, I would love to dive
									deeper into producing microlearning videos and interactive
									training that result in higher trainee engagement.
								</p>
								<p>
									And I work with an incredible team who do great things, and I
									want to ensure the organization continues supporting their
									professional or career goals so they can be our future
									leaders.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong
										>What are the dos and don'ts for corporations during Pride
										Month?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									Do a lot! Highlight your LGBTQI employees and those in the
									community you serve. Donate to LGBTQI non-profit organizations
									and participate in community events. Patronize LGBTQI own/run
									businesses and highlight those businesses for your workforce
									to support. Be visible to LGBTQI youth and express your
									commitment to inclusivity.
								</p>
								<p>
									Do not do anything! Don't do the bare minimum and just change
									your branding to rainbow for the month. And certainly, don't
									limit your support to the LGBTQI community to just June.
									Incorporate your support throughout the year.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong
										>What are some ideas for celebrating Pride Month in the
										remote workplace?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									I've been loving all the LGBTQI virtual town halls and lunch
									and learns put together by organizations for their workforce.
									And it's even better when they are made available for the
									public to attend. I know I have joined several of these myself
									to understand better a company's commitment to the LGBTQI
									community and their support of issues we face. Another idea is
									to create company-specific rainbow logos for employees to use
									as Zoom or Teams backgrounds. Also, consider team-building
									events, such as LGBTQI trivia or bingo, or even a lunch hosted
									by a Drag Queen!
								</p>
								<br />

								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger
										self?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									It's a marathon, not a sprint. So fully embrace the space in
									which you are not a novice nor expert and seek more mentorship
									as you don't have to go through this alone.
								</p>
								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
										be doing now?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									I would be working in healthcare operations, helping to build
									new service lines to reach a larger patient population.
									Sometimes in my role, I feel like my nose is pressed up
									against the window, watching all the action happening and
									seeing great things come to fruition. Luckily, I actively
									participate in this work as a compliance officer, but I miss
									the thrill of creating and directing new initiatives.
								</p>
								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>At the end of your career, if you were to sit and reflect,
										what one hope do you have?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									I hope to reflect and see that I made a positive impact. I
									want to be remembered as someone who is helpful, intelligent,
									honest, and trustworthy. My professional legacy should be that
									I led with integrity and was always of service to others.
