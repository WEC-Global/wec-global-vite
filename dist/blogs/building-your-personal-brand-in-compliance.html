								<p>
									Every time I interview a professional for placement in my
									compliance team, the first question I ask is ‘tell me about
									yourself’. This allows the candidate to speak in an open
									format, and a chance to present an elevator pitch about
									himself/herself. But almost every candidate speaks about
									his/her work experience on all the projects and assignments
									during their career in a chronological order! Yes, that gives
									me a summation of their assignments and work experiences, but
									what is it that differentiates one candidate from another with
									similar profiles? Does he/she have a USP that describes who
									he/she is and what he/she can be valued for, his/her
									strengths, interests, capabilities and so on that makes
									him/her a stronger fit for the role?
								</p>
								<p>
									In today’s world, personal branding has grown extremely
									significant, both within one’s organization as well as
									externally in the global community. It helps in career
									progression, gaining visibility and finding new opportunities
									in employment or business. As I groom Compliance professionals
									in the art of self-branding, here are my top 5 tips on how you
									can build yours:
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Decide on your personal brand</strong> – I have been
									working in banking compliance for over 2 decades now, and
									early in my career my goal was to rise the corporate ladder,
									just like anyone else. But after spending 15 years in the
									industry, my mindset changed from career growth to finding a
									purpose and adding value through my work. That is when I
									decided to focus on my niche – financial crimes compliance –
									and work in this area both internally (within my organization)
									and externally (in the global community). I can see now that
									my brand has developed as an industry leader in this very
									space! Ethics and compliance is a very broad and deep domain,
									so it helps if you narrow down to your own area of expertise
									or interest/aspiration, aligning with what you wish to
									accomplish professionally, and work on developing your brand
									in that focus area.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Stand out through your profile</strong> – Whether it
									is your job resume or social media profile, create your own
									USP that differentiates you from your peers and positions you
									in a premium bracket. In the digital world we live in now, a
									curated social media presence aligning with your chosen focus
									area consistently across multiple platforms can reinforce your
									brand. Your introductions and activities in all these profiles
									must speak about your area of expertise/passion, specific work
									you have done in this field, certifications and publications.
									I generally suggest a 100-word headline in a resume which
									doubles up as your elevator pitch and sets the perception
									about your brand.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Build a Compliance Network</strong> – ‘A man is known
									by the company he keeps’ is an age old proverb. If you are
									interested in anti-bribery investigation, for example, network
									with professionals in anti-bribery & corruption (ABC), join
									related compliance groups and forums, attend events on this
									subject (most webinars are complimentary), follow ABC leaders
									and industry influencers. Asking questions, sharing ideas or
									just being visible in ABC circles will not only strengthen
									your knowledge and resources in this area, but also build your
									credibility as an ABC professional/expert. Women in Ethics &
									Compliance is one such forum which has a galaxy of compliance
									professionals as well as aspirants – undoubtedly a great
									platform to share ideas and grow as a compliance expert!
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Thought Leadership</strong> – Compliance is a very
									dynamic area with rapid changes in Regulations, technology,
									operating models and so on. Sharing your point of view, e.g.
									publishing an analysis of a new Regulation, posting your
									opinion on a news report that can have an impact on
									compliance, talking about an industry challenge and what
									model/innovative process or tool can resolve it and so on
									within your compliance community networks can elevate your
									brand as an original thinker and thought leader. I consciously
									practice this through my dedicated Compliance column in
									‘Corporate Compliance Insights’, articles in reputed journals
									and social media posts, which brought me a lot of visibility
									and led to my speaking engagements in global compliance
									conferences.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Mentor aspiring compliance professionals</strong> –
									Compliance is an area which has assumed immense significance,
									and the role of compliance professionals has grown to be a
									very niche one, which is in high demand but low supply.
									Enabling our current and future workforce, mentoring and
									skilling them in this impactful role can strongly enhance
									one’s brand. I have been actively mentoring aspiring
									professionals and university students interested in a career
									in compliance, e.g. through sessions to students of IE
									University (Madrid), to current and aspiring AML professionals
									in TCAE (Toronto Compliance & AML Events), in addition to
									running a FCC forum within my organization. This has not only
									increased my follower base, but also reinforced my brand as an
									FCC leader.
								</p>
								<p>
									Building one’s brand takes time and conscious effort, but I
									can vouch for the fact that it is worth it! It is not enough
									to know your business, it is equally important to let the
									world know precisely what value you bring, what are your
									unique strengths/traits that make you stronger than your peers
									– that is what sets you apart and makes you a recognized
									leader in your field! With Ethics & Compliance being among the
									top agenda of CXOs across industries today, the time is right
									for Compliance professionals to build their personal brand in
									this space – this is certainly one step to propel your
									business/career!
								</p>

								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger
										self?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									There was a period in my career when I refused travel based
									work assignments, to focus on my personal life in my home
									country, India. But in my career of over 2 decades, I have
									learnt - and would advise my younger self, that every
									opportunity life gives must be taken up, whether personal or
									professional. One need not be paused to focus on the other, as
									every experience enriches us in ways we can never fathom!
								</p>
								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
										be doing now?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									I have always been interested in academics and wanted to teach
									in a University or Management School as a career when I was
									growing up. I have had a long, successful corporate stint, but
									Academics is my passion!
								</p>
								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>If you were to sit and reflect at the end of your career,
										what one hope do you have?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									I hope to have made a difference, howsoever small, that has
									helped human lives and society through my efforts in fighting
									financial crimes, contributing to the industry/community by
									spreading awareness, new ideas and innovations and mentoring
									the next generation in this global combat!
