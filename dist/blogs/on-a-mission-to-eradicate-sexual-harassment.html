						Metta Space is on a mission to eradicate sexual harassment from the
						workplace and allows companies to be compliant with the
						Whistleblowing Directive. It is a deep-tech solution that
						facilitates reporting at the workplace for employee application and
						puts resolution first in the case management solution for employers.
						An NLP algorithm further allows for the creation of a safe and
						healthy culture with the detection of sexual harassment in
						real-time.

									<strong>What is a typical day at Metta Space like?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> I am an early bird, and my
									peak working time is probably from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM. As I
									get hungrier, and the day goes on I have noticed my
									productivity decreases so I usually do something energetic to
									get it back up.
								</p>
								<p>
									We aim to have half a day of meetings and half a day of
									"proper work". We also have specific tasks arranged for
									specific days. This is because if I'm coding, I need to sit
									there for 12 hours straight and code. I can't have two hours
									and then do something else because I'll run into a bug.
								</p>
								<p>
									A usual workday is 08:00 AM to 10:00 PM, so being a founder is
									a little different from normal work. I like to think of the
									golden triangle of sleeping, working, and socializing. I
									consistently try to hit all three. It is hard work, but I have
									a lot of fun doing what I do.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> I would say every day is
									different. We meet with people in different time zones, which
									also massively affects meeting times. As founders, you're
									doing five things at once in different areas of the company. I
									could be doing anything from financial modelling and tech
									stuff to business development and general research. In between
									meetings, at the moment, we are also participants in a couple
									of accelerators. It is a lot, but as Eleanor said, we try to
									balance it out!
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>How did you come up with the name Metta Space?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> We Initially called it
									Moodita, which comes from a Pali word that means "feeling joy
									for the happiness of others". We had a little bee as our logo,
									symbolizing the queen bee community working together. Then we
									found out that (a) people associated it to being moody, and
									(b) in Spanish, it meant a little girl who cannot speak.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> Which means we couldn't
									have been farther from what we were trying to achieve!
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> Some people thought that was
									the whole point, as if we were pointing out that women cannot
									speak up about harassment, so we decided to scratch that
									completely.
								</p>
								<p>
									We chose <em>Metta Space</em>. 'Metta' is also a Pali word and
									'Space' came from the fact that we are creating a safe space -
									our platform is one place where you can do everything
									cohesively. 'Metta' can also be connected back to meta data,
									so those two things came together.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> 'Metta' means loving and
									benevolent in Pali. It is still on the same lines of happiness
									and creating a benevolent space. And it gives us a bit of a
									tech edge as well. I think it sounds a bit rock and roll, to
									be honest.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What has been your driving force? </strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> Definitely seeing that not
									only sexual harassment is a big issue, but that people do not
									speak up about it. Both Eleanor and I are quite extroverted,
									so when it comes to dealing with these issues, we don't have a
									problem turning around and telling you off. But we realized
									that a lot of people don't. The unfortunate issue is that
									people do not have a voice, or platform to report sexual
									harassment: they are not comfortable or safe to report it. So,
									when we researched this further, the scale of the issue dawned
									on us, especially in companies where the procedures in place
									were not effective.
								</p>
								<p>
									We started doing focus groups to understand perceptions and
									attitudes towards reporting. There are a million reasons why
									people do not report, and they are all really justifiable –
									not being believed, fear of repercussions, the behavior
									escalating or being branded as someone who's overreacting.
								</p>
								<p>
									We took everything we learnt, analysed it, and tried to come
									up with a solution to give people a space to report and feel
									safe and supported.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>What goals did you set when you started Metta
										Space?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> The goal starting off was
									simply wanting to do something - we had no clue what or how. I
									said to Eleanor, "we need to do something to change this." She
									said, "Yeah, let's make a WhatsApp group." I said, "No, no, we
									need to go big." We then signed up to our university's Venture
									Lab, with no idea of what we were going to do, except that we
									wanted to help people.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> We wanted to make the women
									around us feel comfortable in speaking up after their sexual
									harassment experiences and ensure that everyone has their
									space to speak up. We also realized it had to go farther than
									just reporting. So, we wanted to create a community of
									individuals who could support one another.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What are your goals right now?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> We realized there isn't
									enough data – not up to date numbers or statistics about
									harassment, so we are pushing for a data-driven approach. We
									want to collect and create as much data as possible and to
									raise awareness.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> Collecting data around
									reporting, case resolution, and natural language processing.
									That gives us a holistic approach to dealing with sexual
									harassment and we've become not just reactive, but more so
									proactive and preventative.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> We want a workplace
									environment where people are respectful to each other, where
									women feel heard and believed. We recognize issues such as
									fake reports, but statistically they're so low compared to
									actual cases that never get addressed. We simply want people
									to not feel alone when they are dealing with sexual
									harassment.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong
										>What was the most challenging part about starting Metta
										Space?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> Although we have
									encountered challenges, they never felt like challenges we
									could not overcome, just slight blips in the way. Our biggest
									challenge was raising investment from outside of our network.
									We have a fantastic network of individuals who have become our
									first investors, but we wanted to try to find investment
									outside our network.
								</p>
								<p>
									That was really difficult, and I think it links to it being
									harder for women to get investment. There is lots of data
									showing that women never raise as much as Men. And adding the
									fact that we're addressing a topic like sexual harassment made
									it hard. That's why Helena and I are quite stubborn when it
									comes to that – we do our research and try to be more
									"aggressive" in our financial approach.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> I think one of the
									challenges was to understand what we want to do and what we
									can do to help with the resources and technical capabilities
									we have. We try to narrow our focus to do a couple of things
									at a time.
								</p>
								<p>
									We also have to constantly adjust our financial model because
									even when we think they are reasonable and based on
									assumptions, we probably need to push them a bit more. Women,
									me especially, tend to be more conservative with financial
									figures than our male counterparts. So, it's a challenge but
									also satisfying. We're also often competing in these all-male
									panels – for example we competed in a fintech/legal tech pitch
									competition a while ago and were the only female founders in
									the entire competition.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> People know of meritocracy,
									but mirror-tocracy is when investors invest in people who look
									and remind them of themselves. If you have white men investing
									in other white men, it's bad for business. Whenever we have a
									meeting with a VC, we ask them what their portfolio looks
									like, how many women they have on their team, and how many
									women they have on their portfolio. They often say they have
									zero, or maybe one.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>What is something that you have learned about yourself
										starting a business?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> Helena makes me a better
									person, but I knew that all along! And secondly, I have no
									balance in my life. We talked about the golden triangle. I
									have to be going out all the time and I have to be working all
									the time. Which means I don't get much sleep.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> I have given up on the
									social life aspect of the triangle. I really need my sleep
									since I'm completely incompetent if I don't sleep enough. But
									that's why it is a good balance between the two of us. She
									socialises, I sleep.
								</p>
								<p>
									We are realizing there are a lot of things we need to learn.
									We are doing so many things that we have never, ever done
									before. All of a sudden, we have to worry about taxes and
									accounting. We have also become way nerdier than we were
									before. We thought we were cool but now I like memes about
									Excel. University-me would be embarrassed.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also, the resilience to push forward. A lot of start-ups tend
									to fail after six months and people have said it is quite
									impressive that we are still on it, working and trying. That's
									definitely something that shows as well – our determination.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>You mentioned resilience and determination, what advice do
										you give to other entrepreneurs who are starting up?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> I honestly think confidence
									– thinking you can do it. We would not have done this if we
									doubted ourselves. It is such a big mission that for us, it
									does not matter how or when we do this, we just want to help
									people. If we start seeing a positive impact, we'll be happy
									with that.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also, ask more of people than what you actually want because
									you usually meet in the middle. Be assertive.
								</p>
								<p>
									Don't underestimate how much people want to help you. We have
									52 ambassadors who help us so much. We have fantastic advisors
									helping us with financials, tech, and HR. That's expertise
									that we just personally don't have.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> You don't realize how
									supportive people can be. Within our network, people are so
									excited about what we are doing, and they want to help in any
									way they can. That has definitely been something that was
									exciting for us to see. But as Eleanor said, you need to
									actually ask for help. And people are really, really, really
									willing to help if they believe in you and what you are doing.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> Worse case, they will say
									"sorry no".
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What are you working on right now?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Eleanor:</em></strong> Our ambassador program – it
									is super exciting. People that help us with anything including
									networking, speaking up against sexual harassment, speaking
									about our work at Metta Space, as well as very specific tasks
									like researching and writing some articles. It has really
									increased our online presence.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong><em>Helena:</em></strong> We are finishing the product
									development of our Beta app, which is really exciting. Our
									software developer, Nora, is a machine. As we mentioned, we're
									also doing two accelerators and working towards getting our
									first customers, proof of concept and finding the right people
									to speak to in a company. And we are in the process of raising
									our angel round.
								</p>
