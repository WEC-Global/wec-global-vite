								As humans, we tend to shy away from things we do not know much
								about. Imagine explaining Dali's paintings or non-fungible
								assets (NFTs) to someone, please, no! We often do not question
								things, either because some things have just been done a
								certain a way or because they are beyond our knowledge.
								Unfortunately, we have similar views on our pension
								investments and saving accounts.
							</p>
							<p>
								Many of us work in corporations that have a pension plan
								arranged for us. They do this by giving investment platforms
								our money, where fund managers invest on our behalf in a
								diversified portfolio with stocks like Apple, Disney or Nike,
								expecting to make a reasonable return and beat the market.
								There's also investment you can make yourself through
								investment platforms like Robinhood or E-TRADE and individual
								savings account (ISA) which has similar concept but without
								you paying the income tax on the investment benefits you have
								up to a certain level. It's simple, right?
							</p>
							<p>
								But what if you do not want to give your money to companies
								that are linked to gender inequality or animal cruelty? What
								if they do not align with your values? What can you do as a
								single consumer to make an impact? With ESG investing you can
								get your fund managers to think about the environmental and
								social footprint of companies. This can be from a financial
								performance perspective - it is less susceptible to risks,
								including reputation, legal and compliance risk and more
								profitable to invest in a company that is say, diversity
								across the board or taking care of the oceans. Of course, you
								can personally change your lifestyle, but our pension
								investments have a far greater impact as they operate on a
								macro level. In May, WEC hosted an event where I sat down with
								Georgia Stewart, the CEO and co-founder of
								<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tumelo.com/personal"
									class="external-link">Tumelo</a>, to learn more on this.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's zoom out for a bit. 2020 has proven the stability of
								companies complying with environmental, social and governance
								metric. Morningstar reported 51 of the 57 that ESG-screened
								indexes outperformed their market equivalents in the first
								quarter of 2020. We have become more aware of social issues
								that fall under ESG purview and find them to be safer
								investments. If a company finds itself amidst a scandal, we
								know that could appear on the news and damage the share price.
								Even fund managers understand that now and invest in
								ESG-screened stocks and indexes to guarantee a safe return for
								their clients.
							</p>
							<p>
								Here are my advice how to create and implement an effective
								compliance program:
							</p>
							<p>
								So where do you begin? It is a good practice to consider
								investment platforms that show you transparent and accessible
								information on every company you wish to own. Do your research
								and find ESG funds and indexes that you feel strongly
								supportive of and share it with your fund manager. Same goes
								for workplace pension but this time, ask your HR about your
								company's pension plans and what it is invested in. Most
								companies will have an ESG fund options aside from the regular
								pension fund plan. Ask them to shuffle your investments and
								move it towards sustainable investing. You may think to
								yourself - why have I not always done this? Well now you can.
							</p>
							<p>
								Impact-focused solution Tumelo offers pension holders and
								retail investors a platform to see all of the companies they
								are invested in and share their opinions on how they wish
								these companies to act. Their goal is to make you more aware
								of where you put your money and bring more transparency to the
								discussion. More importantly, we must know this is not just
								passive investment; we should have an influence on the
								outcomes of these companies. With all our opinions put
								together as investors and/or pension holders, our fund
								managers can collect this information via Tumelo, helping to
								inform their own voting decisions at the board level and their
								wider stewardship policies.
							</p>
							<p>
								When it comes to Tumelo, their platform partners with your
								existing investment and pension applications that you use. You
								give your opinions on decisions being made at companies so
								that they had better align with your values - such as better
								supply chain due diligence or LGBTQ+ policies. This opinion is
								then shared with fund managers who can have a large influence
								on companies.
							</p>
							<p>
								Next time you have a conversation with your pension provider,
								do this:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Learn whether the companies you invest in instils strong ESG
									practices into their operations.
								</li>
								<li>
									Find out if the company must report their socially
									responsible activities to regulators or stock exchanges.
								</li>
								<li>
									Follow C-Suite executives on social platforms like LinkedIn
									and see whether they are truly passionate about ESG.
								</li>
								<li>
									Read up on their Annual Report. Some companies produce ESG
									reporting too. You can analyse their past performance and
									the future goals they have set.
								</li>
								<li>
									Look at their governance structure and identify red flags if
									there are any, i.e., unexplainable reward system, poor
									strategy implementation, low retention rates, nepotism, lack
									of diversity, etc.
								</li>
								<li>
									Familiarize yourself with the industries you have or would
									want to invest it and assess if the changes you propose are
									achievable by companies
								</li>
							</ul>
