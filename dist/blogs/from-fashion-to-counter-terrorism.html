								Lucy Game is a final year International Relations (BA Hons)
								student at the University of Liverpool. She is also an
								Intelligence Analyst Intern and Extremism Team Editor at The
								Counterterrorism Group, as well as a volunteer with the charity
								Care4Calais. She has always had an interest in ethics and
								compliance; particularly, what causes someone to commit
								unethical behavior and what strategies can be adopted to prevent
								this. Coming from a family with a strong legal and policy
								background (her mother was a Senior Policy Advisor for the Civil
								Service) she has always had a clear picture of moral ‘rights’
								and ‘wrongs’ and the value created by advocating for these
								morals through everyday actions. This is what led her down the
								path of counterterrorism as well as my work in championing the
								rights of refugees and asylum seekers with Care4Calais.

									alt="Blow that Whistle!"

								/>
								<p>
									My professional experience in ethics and compliance began with
									various intern placements, one within external buying at Kurt
									Geiger and one in Asset and Profit Protection at Burberry.
									This work introduced me to the legal and ethical side of the
									fashion industry, particularly counterfeiting, illicit
									financing, internal ethics, compliance investigations, and
									ethical sourcing. Before this, I was not aware - maybe I’d
									even go as far to say naive - of the vast behind-the-scenes
									legal and policy work that goes into major brands. At the same
									time as these internships, I was studying for my A-Level
									qualifications, which I undertook in Psychology, Sociology,
									and Politics. At the time of choosing these subjects, they
									were just those I thought seemed interesting, but after a few
									months of study, I realised they were the perfect fit for my
									interests and my strengths.
								</p>
								<p>
									Originally, I had aimed to study a Criminology degree but
									transferred programs to International Relations before the
									commencement of my studies. I believe what shifted my interest
									was a teacher I had for my A-Level Politics course. A tall,
									sharp, and assertive woman from South Africa with the richest
									life experience I had ever encountered and a strong
									take-no-prisoners attitude. From growing up in Apartheid
									Johannesburg, to reporting on the Rwandan Genocide as a
									Journalist before the age of 20, to travelling the world
									working in over 5 different countries and speaking as many -
									if not more - languages. I was amazed by her wisdom, borne as
									a product of her life experience, and always thought I would
									feel very accomplished if I had even achieved half of what she
									had in my own lifetime.
								</p>
								<p>
									I had grown up around and been raised by a plethora of strong
									and inspirational women; I am a child of a single mother who
									has a history in defense and weapons policy. I grew up
									watching in awe of how my mother balanced a career, raising
									two young children, and at one point being the primary
									caregiver for my terminally ill father. I have always felt
									there was an underappreciated magic about women, the drive and
									resilience held by many before and many to come to mark their
									place in this world and leave a positive impact on others in
									the process. Women have an incredible power to develop the
									world into a kinder, more moral, and more ethical place, and I
									believe this is what motivates me in my work.
								</p>
								<p>
									The work of counterterrorism, and international relations as a
									more general field, is innately tied to ethical practice. When
									I decided to go down the path of international relations and
									counterterrorism, I felt this was where I would be able to
									have the most significant impact on the lives of others around
									me. This area has allowed me to hone my skills and interests
									in the areas of geopolitics and global security that are most
									important to me. These include, advocating for legal
									provisions protecting the rights of minorities, considering a
									racialised and gendered perspective in all intelligence
									analysis, and working to promote ethical norms for the
									management of displaced persons and asylum seekers. I consider
									myself incredibly lucky to have been born in an economically
									and politically stable country, allowing me to receive a
									strong education and therefore feel there is a moral
									imperative to use this to help improve the lives of those less
									fortunate wherever possible.

										self?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									Worry less - stop being anxious about what you may or may not
									achieve and focus that energy into things that bring you joy.
									Find balance in your life and don’t put all your eggs in one
									basket.
								</p>
								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
										be doing now?</strong

								</p>
								<p>
									Maybe something in fashion. I like how freeing fashion and
									makeup can be; it can be used as an expression of whatever you
									would like it to be, and send messages far and wide. Fashion
									knows no language and no boundaries.
								</p>
								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>At the end of your career, if you were to sit and reflect,

								</p>
								<p>
									I hope that I consider whatever I have accomplished a success.
									Success will be relative to me at that point in time, but for
									now, success means happiness, well-roundedness, balance, and
									internal peace. I hope I can feel that I have fulfilled my
									purpose and made the world, even just marginally, a better
									place.
