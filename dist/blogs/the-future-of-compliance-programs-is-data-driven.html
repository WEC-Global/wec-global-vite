								alt="The Future of Compliance Programs is Data-Driven"
								class="blogpost__article-image pb-2" />
							<p>
								Anytime someone asks me how I think compliance programs are,
								can be, or should be evolving, my answer is always the same –
								compliance programs should look to have more integrated
								processes and to be more data-driven. This answer really
								shouldn’t be that surprising given that data has infiltrated
								nearly every other business function and even our personal
								lives.
							</p>
							<p>
								As wise men and women before me have said for centuries,
								knowledge and information is power. And organizational
								functions such as commercial and sales teams have long
								leveraged the use of data to inform business decisions and
								strategy. From sales revenue numbers to market research, data
								has played an integral role in these “core” business
								functions. However, until very recently, compliance functions
								have not reaped the benefits of data and analytics to both
								measure the effectiveness of their programs or to influence
								behavior and decision making.
							</p>
							<p>
								For more than a decade, U.S. regulators have expected
								companies to measure the effectiveness of their compliance
								programs. Most traditional approaches to measure effectiveness
								have included key performance indicators (KPIs), such as the
								number of hotline or incident reports, the percentage of
								substantiated investigations, training completion records, and
								other similar metrics. But these methods often fall short
								without additional context, comparative data, year-over-year
								trends, or other information. For example, a 50%
								substantiation rate of investigations could be indicative of a
								decrease of non-compliant activity if the prior year’s
								substantiation rate was 80%. However, that same metric could
								signal a completely different situation if that percentage was
								previously less than 10%. Without these comparative data
								points and trending, that 50% substantiation rate is rendered
								nearly meaningless to truly inform the health of your
								compliance program.
							</p>
							<p>
								Furthermore, metrics and the groups or systems from which they
								are derived are often siloed and sometimes only provide a
								fragmented view of the whole picture. A 99% training
								completion rate – again, a common compliance metric used to
								measure effectiveness – could provide a false sense of
								security. However, when viewed in the context of audit
								findings that have identified significant process deviations,
								that training statistic essentially means that while nearly
								your entire company completed the training, it appears the
								training was not effective, misunderstood, or perhaps even
								just forgotten. These examples highlight the deficiencies in
								simply looking at singular metrics or KPIs to measure the
								effectiveness of your program.
							</p>
							<p>
								So, how do compliance programs follow their organizational
								counterpart’s lead in harnessing the power of data and
								technology to enhance their program’s effectiveness and even
								influence behavior? Interestingly (and often not readily
								recognized), a compliance function is often uniquely
								positioned to have access to or to be able to request access
								to various data sources across its organization as well as
								having access to its own data sources. These data sources,
								such as HR information, expense reports, and spend
								transactions coupled with compliance metrics can provide a
								wealth of insights to a compliance function particularly when
								sophisticated data analyses are applied. Such analyses can
								identify trends over time and, when automated or supported by
								a technology solution, can be run across 100% of transactions,
								which is far more comprehensive than a traditional approach of
								looking at a sample or targeted set of transactions. These
								analyses can run the gamut from single tests to identify
								policy violations to more sophisticated algorithms that
								identify spend anomalies, thus providing a more data-driven
								view of how your compliance processes and controls are
								working.
							</p>
							<p>
								In addition to measuring the effectiveness of a compliance
								program, data and analytics can play a significant role in
								influencing human behavior, including approval decisions.
								Traditional pre-approval processes and solutions tend to be
								limited in the amount of insights provided about the
								particular approval request. However, data analytics can
								enhance the pre-approval process by providing contextual
								analytics, aggregate spend information, or even monitoring
								results. For example, an approver may be able to review a
								pre-approval request to host a meeting in the context of other
								meeting requests to see if the spend amount per recipient is
								an outlier or if any of the recipients are receiving support
								over an aggregated threshold limit. A compliance officer
								reviewing a due diligence request to engage a third party can
								make a more informed decision if they have at their fingertips
								access to monitoring results that reflect that a majority of
								past transactions with that third party have been flagged with
								compliance issues. Much like how data is used to influence
								sales, purchasing, and other business decisions, there are
								limitless opportunities to use data to ultimately help
								individuals make better compliance-related decisions.
							</p>
							<p>
								While today’s compliance programs are still largely reactive
								focusing on the issues of the day or those under regulatory
								investigation, thanks largely due to the accessibility of data
								and the availability of technology solutions, I see a huge
								opportunity for compliance programs to turn the tide to be
								more proactive and influence compliant behavior.

								<strong>What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger
									self?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								One piece of advice that I wish I had been given when I was
								younger and that I often hear colleagues and friends lament is
								to foster and maintain relationships early in your career.
								Networking and making connections is not something that comes
								easily or naturally to me, but I’ve learned as I’ve advanced
								in my career that business relationships don’t have to be
								forced or formal, and the outcome can be so (mutually)
								invaluable.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
									be doing now?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I am a voracious reader and would love to someday open or run
								a bookstore.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you were to sit and reflect at the end of your career,
									what one hope do you have?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								In the context of my current career, my one hope is that I
								have contributed in some way, no matter how small, to make it
								easier for people to do the right thing or make the right
								decision.
