								<p>
									I feel very honoured to be asked to write an article about IP
									for WEC Global, which is an organisation that I supported
									since the very early days of its creation.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I was asked, I was also given a word count that I should
									stick to. Well, I must admit that normally it is quite a
									challenge for me to write only a few words about IP, as I
									always like to expand the subject. Let me start with Bill
									Gate’s most well-known phrase about IP: "Intellectual property
									has the shelf life of a banana."
								</p>
								<p>
									That is true and furthermore, intellectual property if not
									protected can also be stolen. Accordingly, having the right
									type of intellectual property protection helps you to stop
									people stealing or copying the names of your products or
									brands, your inventions, the design or look of your products
									and things you write, make or produce.
								</p>
								<p>
									Let’s understand what intellectual property means and why it
									has such a short shelf life and vulnerability.
								</p>
								<p>
									In simple words, intellectual property is something that you
									create using your mind – for example, a story, an invention,
									an artistic work or a symbol. It is an area of law that
									governs the ownership and accessibility of ideas and
									inventions on tangible and intangible concepts from human
									creativity, invention, and business endeavour. If we're using
									legal terms, we would say that it is copyright, patents and
									trademarks.
								</p>
								<p>
									In summary, to clarify each of them I will start with
									copyright, which are laws that are originally designed to
									encourage people to create. Namely, to create art, music,
									literature, film, video and all of those things. Patents are
									about the area of science and technology. Patent Laws are
									designed to help people invent, i.e., create new inventions –
									things like laptops and pharmaceuticals.
								</p>
								<p>
									And finally, trademarks are those things that we are used to
									every day to the point that for the disappointment of
									trademark owners they sometimes become part of our language.
									We might say something like, “we got out of bed, put on our
									Levi's, used the Colgate and ate some Weetabix” and everyone,
									well most people speaking English, at least, know what we
									mean. “As you pulled on your jeans, brushed your teeth, and
									ate some breakfast cereal.”
								</p>
								<p>
									The law intends to protect these innovations and provide
									people exclusive rights to use the products or services for a
									period of time in order to encourage businesses to work and
									succeed as well as to encourage invention and creative
									endeavours. What the law doesn't do is guarantee that anyone
									who creates anything artistic, like an event, or scientific
									will get a market, i.e., will be able to sell their work.
								</p>
								<p>
									Accordingly, entrepreneurs and various organizations try and
									use intellectual property law as a tool to make their business
									work, to make money and achieve recognition. But it's not the
									law of intellectual property that creates business profits;
									however, businesses can use intellectual property rights to
									help them create those profits.
								</p>
								<p>
									Intellectual property law is the helping hand used to help
									social entrepreneurs succeed in business, giving them the leg
									up to be innovative and explorative as they work to improve
									social circumstances that exist in societies everywhere.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally organizations can utilize the power of intellectual
									property law to help creative minds as they develop
									improvements within society, while also working on sustainable
									initiatives that will be protected by the law to not only help
									protect trademarks and copyrights of entrepreneurs and their
									free market initiatives, but also ensure that entrepreneurs
									will want to engage in solving some of the society’s problems
									in the first place, knowing that they will be helping society
									while profiting from their good works, as well.
								</p>
								<p>
									The stakes of the developers of technology have become very
									high, and hence, the need to protect the knowledge from
									unlawful use has become expedient, at least for a period, that
									would ensure recovery of the R&D and other associated costs
									and adequate profits for continuous investments in R&D.
								</p>

									<strong>One piece of advice for your younger self.</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Be your best at all times, you never know what the future will
									bring, so always make the best use of the present and always
									remember to do what is right, not what is easy. Strength of
									character leads us to do the right thing, even when there are
									easier ways.
								</p>
								<p class="pb-0">

										>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
										be doing now?</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									I would be writing fiction. I have one fiction book published
									but would like to have time to write more as I have so many
									stories in my head.
								</p>
								<p class="pb-0">
									<strong
										>At the end of your career, if you were to sit and reflect,

									A better health systems and infrastructure for the developing
									countries and access to medicines. Public health systems are
									always susceptible to fashions, political vagaries, and Health
									systems and the challenge of communicable diseases due to
