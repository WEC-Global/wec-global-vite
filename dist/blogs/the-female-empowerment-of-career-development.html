								Kirstie Burn, who has more than 20 years’ worth of recruitment
								experience, heads up the MERJE Compliance and Financial Crime
								team in London (also covering Risk and Legal).
							</p>
							<p>
								She is also responsible for the delivery of successful
								recruitment campaigns, focusing on the Retail Banking and
								Financial Services sectors.
							</p>
							<p>
								With a background in management development and training,
								Kirstie has always enjoyed the relationship building side to the
								job, whether that is meeting new contacts, networking at any
								event (particularly if there is a nice cocktail involved) or
								ensuring that existing relationships are kept strong.
							</p>
							<p>
								Kirstie always has lots of well-laid plans to attend her gym
								class. However, her appreciation of a crisp white wine means
								that she is more likely to be found socialising (or networking!)
								in a city establishment.
							</p>
							<p>
								With three sons at home, she justifies the time out of the house
								as she can often be found running around the park at the
								weekends with her children.

								<p>
									Over my professional life, I have seen a strong percentage of
									my female candidates needing support and coaching when
									applying for a new role, positioning themselves for an
									interview with a potential future employer or when wishing to
									consider an internal promotion.
								</p>
								<p>
									We cannot deny we live in a gender defined world – from
									education, social constraints, relationships, media, and
									wellbeing/mental health. The awareness of this is key. We can
									admit and acknowledge this, but we do not, of course, need to
									conform to a stereotype. Please let me state quickly that I
									absolutely detest labels and stereotypes, and anyone who knows
									me will vouch for this – even when I had my first child and
									was introduced at a baby group as ‘George’s mummy’, I felt an
									overwhelming wave of possession over my identity to state, yes
									‘Kirstie’ (please don’t label me ;)).
								</p>
								<p>
									However, when it comes to job hunting, interviewing, or
									negotiating a job offer or internal promotion, many women have
									a sense of preferring to prove themselves in role before being
									considered for a career development opportunity. I have found
									more male candidates would state their confidence and
									capability to take on a new role without having to necessarily
									evidence this in delivery before starting this type of
									conversation.
								</p>
								<p>
									A decision in regard to someone’s candidacy for an opportunity
									certainly does not always need to be proven in delivery before
									gaining this confidence from a business. We all have seen
									examples of this. We do not need to demonstrate success in
									role first. Women often suggest they should be doing the role
									for a period of time before being acknowledged for it in title
									or salary.
								</p>
								<p>
									To counterbalance our conscious or unconscious bias, we must
									be able to identify our strengths and competencies, pushing
									away any constraints that our social gender programming may
									have created and then the skill is in how to empower ourselves
									to demonstrate this when job hunting, interviewing or asking
									for a promotion.
								</p>
								<p>
									When looking for a new role, remember that a job description
									is aspirational. It needs to have some elements of unchartered
									territory to allow the applicant to feel that there is a
									growth opportunity. At least a medium-long term potential
									where their skills and experience will be enhanced through
									further personal and professional development and advancement.
									Once you are aware of the job purpose, consider what
									competencies and behaviours would support the delivery of this
									purpose and then reflect – is this you? If so, apply away!
								</p>
								<p>
									At interviews, instead of using the language, ‘may’, ‘could’,
									‘perhaps’, I would advise that my candidates consider how
									language creates perception and engenders confidence. A better
									use of stronger language would be to say ‘I will, do, can’
									etc. Try to use first person so the interviewer can understand
									your personal contribution to the example you are giving and
									remember this is your time to shine (as we are often
									programmed at work to acknowledge the team. This is not that
									time.
								</p>
								<p>
									When negotiating an offer do note that more women than men
									will accept a similar salary or less to get the right role –
									to buck this trend, I would recommend researching the salary
									you should be paid and also understand what the remuneration
									should be to reflect the expectations of the role. To do this,
									if you are unaware of the salary points within your firm or
									your future employer, you can search for adverts with similar
									roles in similar industries and sized companies on job boards
									(e.g., Indeed, City Jobs etc.) or look on your
									company/competitor’s career pages, to help open these
									conversations about your value proposition. If you are being
									asked what you expect, make sure you don’t only look at a
									percentage increase on your current. Benchmark where the role
									sits as a salary level in the market, check your peer group’s
									salaries if possible or relevant and talk to a good contact in
									the recruitment industry (like me!) to ask where they see your
									salary should be positioned.
								</p>
								<p>
									CNBC quoted that a majority of women, 60%, say they have never
									negotiated with an employer over pay. But that may be leading
									to women changing jobs more frequently, since 72% say they
									will leave an employer to get a salary bump somewhere else.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once you understand your ‘value’ proposition, reflect on how
									much this expectation is being matched by what your employer
									is offering. There are so many factors as to why people look
									for a new role: remit/responsibilities, level, salary, title,
									location, flexibility, benefits, reporting line, team etc.
									When you are clear on what is most important to you, you can
									then combine the knowledge of your value vs. what is important
									for you to have in the role to reach the best outcome for your
									career. Your personal check in on this is very important, as
									you regularly review how any of these factors may change over
									time.
								</p>
								<p>
									This by no means reflects all however, if you feel you would
									benefit from taking a more empowered approach to your career
									development, reach out to that individual at work or in your
									personal life who you have seen has taken control and driven
									their success. Find out what and how they achieved this. Make
									sure you are as informed as possible about what is happening
									in your career sphere, outside of your firm (benchmark) and
									always use a good contact in the recruitment/search industry
									for advice. Good luck!
