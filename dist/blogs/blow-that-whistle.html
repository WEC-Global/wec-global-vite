								<strong>What a Whistleblowing Hotline means</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Implemented correctly, whistleblowing hotlines are powerful
								tools for exposing fraud, bullying, malpractice,
								discrimination and more.
							</p>
							<p>
								Historically, the term 'whistleblowing hotline' referred to a
								telephone-based reporting service. It is now used as a
								collective term to describe all forms of whistleblowing
								systems, including online whistleblowing.
							</p>
							<p>
								A well-managed hotline is compliant, accessible, free of
								charge at the point of use and inclusive. Ideally, employees
								should have access to the following: a secure, easy to use,
								and independently managed, internal reporting process 24/7/365
								accessibility. The choice of reporting via telephone, mobile,
								on-line or in-person so they can report in a way that is most
								comfortable for the individual and with the option to report
								in the whistle-blower's native language. The hotline should be
								confidential, enable anonymous reporting in jurisdictions
								where allowed and facilitate on-going communication with
								whistle-blowers who wish not to identify themselves.
							</p>

							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>How do they work?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								The whistleblowing hotline provider will give the company with
								a unique URL for web-based reporting and freephone number(s),
								country specific, which are promoted within the business
								through awareness materials, induction training, policies etc.
								Awareness is key to the success of the hotline. If individuals
								do not know that it is available and how to make a report,
								then it has no value. There are 3 ways to make a report:
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>A. Telephone reporting:</strong> the whistle-blower
								calls the freephone number to speak to a person and make a
								report in their native language. An interpreter will join the
								call as required and a three-way conversation will take place.
								Using a series of probing and thoughtful questions, the call
								handler gains an understanding of what occurred, those
								involved, witnesses, and any potential impacts. To verify the
								information, callers are read the final report. This is done
								to ensure the information is accurate and assure the caller
								his/her concern has been captured appropriately. At the end of
								the call, the call handler and the whistle-blower exchange
								information whereby the report is accessible by the caller to
								make updates, or to check for feedback from the company.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>B. Online reporting:</strong> the whistle-blower logs
								on to the company specific web reporting page via the company
								specific URL to make a report; language options may be
								available. The whistle-blower is presented with the
								investigative questions, these are the same questions that
								would be asked if reporting via the telephone. When the
								whistle-blower has finished the report, he/she will have the
								report access information which can be used to make updates to
								the report, or to check for feedback from the company.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>C. Mobile reporting:</strong> the whistle-blower uses
								the company specific URL or QR code to access the simplified
								reporting page to make a report. As above, the questions help
								to provide a good understanding of the concerned matter. When
								the whistle-blower has submitted his/her report, he/she will
								have report access information which can be used to make
								updates to the report, or to check for feedback from the
								company.
							</p>
							<p>
								The report is processed by a member of the dispatch team and
								is made accessible to the company's authorised personal
								(excluding, if applicable, any implicated parties) via a
								secure Case Management System (CSM). Where the whistle-blower
								has provided their contact details these will be passed to the
								company, otherwise the report will be anonymised, and the case
								number becomes their identity. The company's authorised
								personnel will receive an email alert to inform them a new or
								update to a report has been received. The authorised personnel
								can log on to the CMS using their unique log in details to
								view the report, send feedback/ask further questions to the
								whistle-blower, log the investigation, talk to colleagues,
								access/create management reporting and more.
							</p>
							<p>
								Obtaining feedback - The whistle-blower can either call the
								freephone number to speak to someone in person, or log onto
								the web or mobile reporting site to view the feedback that has
								been left by the company by using his/her report access
								information.
							</p>
							<p>
								Anonymous communication can continue until a case is closed by
								the company. The outcomes can be logged on the CMS which could
								be substantiated, partially-substantiated, or not
								substantiated.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>What are the regulations / regulated processes in this
									field and how does it work in reality?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Regulations vary between industries/countries; it is a highly
								complex area and is a rapidly evolving landscape. Our secure
								reporting hotlines simplify compliance to local regulations
								and privacy laws. The incident tracking software monitors
								where incidents happen and is configured for GDPR, SOX, EU
								Whistleblowing Directive, CCPA and PIPEDA requirements.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>What are the hidden risks/difficulties in operating a
									whistle-blower line? What do you have to keep an eye on the
									most?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Hotlines require governance, management, promotion and right
								tone from the top: employees must have confidence in the
								service. Watch out for common themes, which in isolation might
								seem insignificant but can be part of a larger problem.
								Investigations must be handled sensitively and confidentially
								to protect the whistle-blower and the implicated party. Make
								sure all reports are taken seriously and responded to in a
								timely manner. Access to reports should be kept to a minimum,
								only the people who need to know. Companies should demonstrate
								zero tolerance to malicious reports and any retaliation on the
								whistle-blower.
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>What are the biggest advantages of operating such
									line?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								An effective hotline promotes an <strong>open</strong>,
								<strong>honesty</strong>, and
								<strong>accountable culture</strong> where employees can
								express their concerns without fear of reprisal.
							</p>
							<p>
								Protecting brand reputation is often a key motivator when a
								business chooses to introduce a whistleblowing hotline. For
								most organisations, there is no better information source than
								its employees. However, corrupt, and illegal behaviour often
								goes undetected because employees fear the consequences of
								reporting them through existing internal channels.
							</p>
							<p>
								If employees or third parties do not have access to an
								independent reporting channel provided by the organisation,
								they may choose to use alternative public channels, such as
								going to the press or taking legal action.
							</p>
							<p>
								A whistleblowing hotline can give an organisation early
								insight into a potential issue and reduce the likelihood of
								potentially damaging information reaching the public domain.
