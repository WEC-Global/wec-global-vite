							<p>
								According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, choice is the act or power of choosing; and
								suggests the opportunity or privilege of choosing freely. Choice is the power to decide.
							</p>
							<p>
								Choice is also a privilege, and we must use it wisely and consider the principles, rules
								and guardrails that guide and direct us in our personal lives, with our families and
								friends, in our work lives, and in our communities. We must be informed about our
								choices, be accountable and take them carefully. Our choices reflect who we are -
								including how and with whom we spend time, who we work for and work with, who and what
								we patronize, what causes we support, and for whom we lobby and vote. As Ethics and
								Compliance professionals, we can influence people's choices in the workplace, but we do
								not take this responsibility lightly. Yet, before getting to that, I wanted to share
								some real-life examples about the power of choice.
							</p>
							<p>
								I recently bought concert tickets, and as it turned out, the performer supports an
								organization whose mission I find objectionable, and he was scheduled to perform at its
								convention. Knowing this, I still chose to attend the concert anyway, but it got me
								thinking about choice. He has the choice to support his causes, and I had the choice not
								to support him. This is not cancel-culture, this is the exercise of choice.
							</p>
							<p>
								Memorial Day is a day in the U.S. for remembrance of those who have died in service to
								our country. But on that day, a store owner chose to fly a flag on his storefront on the
								main path of those attending the memorial service that represented a very unpopular
								view. Some pointed out that there is no constitutional prohibition against flying any
								kind of flag and individuals have the First Amendment right to express themselves.
								However, having a choice doesn't mean that the actor is insulated from a response. As
								the former mayor said, “He has a right to freedom of speech, and people have the right
								not to shop there.”
							</p>

							<p>
								The pandemic led to discussion about choice as well. At the height of the pandemic and
								with the skyrocketing death rates, masks became mandatory, and places of business
								required employees and patrons to get vaccinated. These mandates were put in place to
								save lives on a very big scale. Some argued that mandatory masks and vaccinations took
								away their free choice. Nonetheless, people still had the choice to not wear masks, to
								not get vaccinated, and to find viable alternatives that accommodated their choice, but
								they also had to bear the consequences. Employers had the right to let go employees who
								didn't comply with their policies, including the workplace safety protocols. So, for
								some, their choice meant losing their job, freedom to travel, and maybe even their
								social circles. But that was their choice, and they made it freely.
							</p>
							<p>
								The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade in 1973, establishing that women have a
								right to get an abortion before a fetus could survive outside of its mother's womb.
								After this time, states could choose to restrict abortion - as long as there were
								exceptions to preserve the life or health of a pregnant woman. If Roe v. Wade is
								overturned, legislators at the state and local levels will have substantial power to
								limit abortion rights. What's at stake is choice - a woman's choice to decide what is
								best for her body, her health, her family, and her future. Taking away this choice has
								implications not only for these women and their partners, but also for our workforce,
								our communities, our economy, and our nation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Ethics & Compliance professionals work hard to protect the company. They are guided by a
								moral compass and build teams that role model and promote the importance of speaking up
								for what's right. E&C professionals lay the groundwork - the rules of the road - for
								ethical behavior with policies and procedures, training and communications, tools, and
								controls. They partner with others to create a culture of compliance through tone at the
								top, communications, and measures to assess and mitigate risk. They empower employees to
								be company advocates and to hold the business accountable when necessary. E&C
								professionals also hope that what they've done will be sufficient to prepare employees
								for the moment which will lead to good decision-making, to an ethical choice. The saying
								goes, “you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink,” and this is true in
								the E&C world as well. When an employee is at the cross-roads of a decision, it is
								ultimately their choice on how to act. There is great power in choice, and if we've done
								our jobs well, that choice will be made for good.
							</p>
							<p>Choice allows us to fight for what we think is right for ourselves and others, to use our
								voice to express it, to join and be affiliated with organizations that share our values
								and that have a mission we can get behind, and to use our feet when we chose otherwise.
								There are rules of the road to live by and to function as a responsible, law-abiding
								citizen in society, but every person should be able to choose - to have the power to
								decide - within the confines of these rules. Choice must be protected.</p>
