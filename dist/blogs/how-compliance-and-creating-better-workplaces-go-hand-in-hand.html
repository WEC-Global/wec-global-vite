                                The word compliance does not tend to inspire particular excitement among employees.
                                Usually associated with financial penalties or legal restrictions, and dealt with
                                internally by a specialised team of experts and lawyers. It's unlikely that employees
                                are aware of the huge role that compliance can play in creating safe, and therefore
                                better, work environments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the European Union, we're currently seeing a massive shift towards implementing
                                stronger compliance cultures in companies, especially when it comes to employee
                                protection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>New regulation to protect employees</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the more significant shifts is the EU Whistleblowing Directive. Having come into
                                force in December 2021, all companies registered in the EU or operating in the EU, must
                                now abide by certain standards (such as allowing for anonymous reporting) to ensure that
                                whistleblowers can report issues of workplace misconduct, safe from any form of
                                retaliation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's an important step for companies that have previously seen <a target="_blank"

                                    retribution</a>. Such retaliation included: losing their jobs, not being promoted,
                                low performance reviews and general ostracisation by peers. Nonetheless, since 2020,
                                there has been a <a target="_blank"

                                trend is roughly similar in Europe, which means that employees are feeling empowered to
                                report workplace misconduct. The new Whistleblowing Directive ensures companies stay on
                                the pulse in regards to employee satisfaction and any harmful business practices, by
                                promoting trust and transparency - lest we forget, <a target="_blank"

                                The benefits of being compliant with the EU Whistleblowing Directive goes both ways: it
                                gives companies the unique opportunity to double down on their culture and values,
                                whilst also encouraging employees to speak up about wrongdoings in the workplace, which
                                can have huge effects on employee satisfaction and morale.

                                With Gen Z entering the workforce (myself included), companies must meet certain
                                standards when it comes to their workplace culture: <a target="_blank"

                                    class="external-link">90% of young talent expect more</a> from their employers than
                                any previous generation. Beyond better pay, Gen Z is looking for a company that reflects
                                their own values in terms of diversity, inclusion, or simply safety and mutual respect.

                                Bearing this in mind, we can go one step further and argue that compliance has a hidden
                                role as well - not only complying with the law but also complying with employees'
                                demands and expectations. Implementing systems for whistleblower protection, creates
                                trust between companies and their employees and promotes employee loyalty, ensuring that
                                each individual can thrive professionally and work to their fullest potential without
                                worries of workplace misconduct, or fear of retaliation if they flag it up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As of today, more than 1/3 of companies do not yet have a whistleblowing system in
                                place. Already this does not promote feelings of safety, transparency and trust within
                                their workforce. On top of this, more traditional industries, such as insurance, are
                                lagging behind in generally implementing better cultural standards within their
                                workplaces. Problems with talent retention and attraction have become top priorities for
                                organisations today as they become increasingly aware of the high standards of employees
                                - both culturally and legally.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>So what should companies do?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Companies must set up better whistleblowing procedures from their previous, unused
                                hotlines. Ensuring anonymity is no longer enough. Companies must go one step further and
                                prove to their employees that they are protected from retaliation and effective
                                resolution of cases is their number one priority. This means additional training,
                                awareness (these systems won't help if employees don't know they exist) and effective
                                resolution methods. Additionally, it can be helpful to include employees into the
                                conversation of implementing these systems, to allow them to feel safe and heard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being compliant creates better work environments. But you need to have a good workplace
                                culture, with a united and communicative workforce in the first place, to achieve the
                                right level of compliance effectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Choosing to set up external whistleblowing technology comes with its benefits. It is
                                highly private for employees coming forward and has the ability to resolve cases more
                                rapidly. Pair that with strong ethics guidelines, clear resolution processes as well as
                                empowered employees, and you'll have a winning combo for a strong foundation of a good
                                company culture.
