							<p>
								Training and communication are ethics and compliance
								components that I think about often. I think about what makes
								training engaging, and how to communicate my training program
								in a way that is persuasive and can influence behaviour.
								Subject matter experts agree that training is one of the
								cornerstones of any ethics and compliance program's objective
								to promote an ethical culture, communicate leadership's
								message on the company's commitments to ethical values, laws,
								standards, policies and procedures, and mitigate risk.
							</p>
							<p>
								I believe the importance of training in any ethics and
								compliance program cannot be overstated, chiefly because
								regulators demand that training and communications form an
								integral part of any ethics and compliance program. In
								addition, training creates the added value of keeping ethics
								and compliance issues top of mind in employees. This is
								especially true if communication is done well and in an
								ongoing fashion that reinforces the ethical and compliance
								messaging a company's governing authority seeks to convey.
								This will, in turn, mitigate risk and keep the company away
								from reputational and legal trouble.
							</p>
							<p>
								Further, because regulators understand that an effective
								training program is an essential component of any ethics and
								compliance program, they have laid out guidance in several
								guidance documents that describe training practices companies
								can adopt. In my opinion, the France Agence Francaise
								Anticorruption (Hereafter AFA) guidance document does a
								wonderful job of outlining practical ethics and compliance
								training best practices and is rooted in learning theories
								that, if adopted, can facilitate training effectiveness. I
								will highlight the training guidance notes from the U.S.
								Department of Justice and France AFA.
							</p>
							<p>
								The US DOJ, in evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of
								any company's ethics and compliance program, lays out in its
								Evaluation of Corporate Compliance Programs guidance document
								various topics prosecutors will consider in deciding the
								effectiveness of any program. One of them is 'Training and
								Communication'. The DOJ gives some pointers as to compliance
								best practices - in stating that 'a hallmark of a
								well-designed compliance program is appropriately tailored
								training and communications'.
							</p>
							<p>
								In assessing a company's compliance program, the DOJ will
								consider the steps taken by the company to embed its policies
								and procedures into its operations. In particular, the DOJ
								will consider the following:
							</p>
							<ul style="
										list-style-position: inside;
										padding-bottom: 1.4rem;
										text-align: left;
									">
								<li>
									The frequency of training including certifications for all
									directors, officers, relevant employees, and where
									appropriate, agents and business partners.
								</li>
								<li>
									Whether the company communicates training in a risk-based
									approach including the extent to which a company has
									measured the impact of training on employee behavior or
									operations.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The DOJ also requires that the company explain its rationale
								for its choice of form and content of the training program.
								They also expect to see prior compliance incidents form part
								of the training program and whether employees are tested on
								their knowledge.
							</p>
							<p>
								The AFA's guidance joins others to advocate for a risk-based
								approach to training programs, in other words, training for
								those employees with the greatest exposure to ethics and
								compliance risks. The purpose of this is to promote vigilance,
								inform high-risk employees of the due diligence obligations
								required for their role, the behavior to adopt in high-risk
								scenarios, and to assume ownership of the company's compliance
								program.
							</p>
							<p>
								What I find interesting about the AFA's guidance, is that it
								recommends best practices in compliance and ethics training
								and is rooted in a potpourri of adult learning theories that
								include self-directed, experiential and transformational
								learning.
							</p>
							<p>
								The AFA advocates training as a tool that can drive compliant
								behavior, overseen by senior management. It emphasizes the
								importance of using interactive training techniques rooted in
								self-directed, experiential, and transformational learning
								theories in recommending, communication toolkits and
								customized group meetings where employees are trained using
								case studies and complex ethics and compliance scenarios that
								can drive discussions about their experiences, responses, and
								conclusions. This gives a hands-on approach to training.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, training appears to be a challenging aspect in ethics
								and compliance programs. A 2016 survey conducted by Compliance
								Week and Deloitte found that 41% of compliance professionals
								find developing a training program that addresses risks a
								challenging aspect. So, compliance professionals are often
								concerned with the best way to develop a training program that
								meets the ethics and compliance objective that will engender
								participation and ownership, including the extent to which the
								training program will influence behavior.
							</p>
							<p>
								To overcome these challenges, I join other commentators in
								suggesting that compliance professionals can reimagine their
								training programs using insights developed from adult learning
								theories. Ethics and compliance professionals can find
								adopting a hands-on approach to their training programs
								useful. The goal of any training according to the
								transformational learning theory is to drive engagement and
								use complex and disorienting ethics and compliance scenarios
								to challenge trainee's beliefs, the purpose is to get the
								trainees to think about how these scenarios could translate
								into their daily work in hopes to transform their thinking.
								Perfect for high-risk group training.
							</p>
							<p>
								Experiential training takes a similar approach and emphasizes
								reflection, it puts trainees in the driver's seat and asks
								them to reflect on ethics and compliance scenarios and test
								their judgment levels. Innovative compliance training methods
								like e-learning, games, and other interactive formats are
								perfect tools.
							</p>
							<p>
								Self-directed training is rooted in providing trainees with
								toolkits and counseling that helps them make the right
								decisions. This theory attempts to explain that adults are
								self-motivated learners. For example, the availability of
								ethics and compliance toolkits in the form of infographics
								help employees understand how to deal with customs that
								approach them for kickbacks at the airport, with guidance
								documents that explain to your public affairs team how to
								interact with government officials, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								Ultimately, compliance professionals must figure out the best
								way to make their training programs engaging, applicable,
								relevant, and engender employee participation and ownership.
								This should be based on a careful strategy that recognizes the
								company's risk profile and unique culture, customizes content
								to employee roles and risk levels, utilizes effective adult
								learning techniques and fresh content, and strives for
								continuous improvement. Seeking out industry best practices in
								all these areas is a great place to get started if you're
								looking for innovative ways to advance your program.
