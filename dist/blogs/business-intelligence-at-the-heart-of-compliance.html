							<p>
								The internet has become a prevalent part of people's daily
								lives globally. It enables us to stay connected with family or
								friends living abroad, or improve our reputation, and promote
								our own businesses. In other words, our online footprint
								provides a comprehensive picture of who we are as an
								individual or what our business represents. And, as the
								Covid-19 pandemic hit, we spent even more time engaging with
								others online. As such, it is also the first place to start
								for a business intelligence investigation - an increasingly
								important element of a due diligence assignment prior to a new
								engagement.
							</p>
							<strong>
								<ol>
									<li class="pb-1 pt-1">
										What is business intelligence research?
									</li>
								</ol>
							</strong>
							<p>
								Business intelligence research focuses on identifying risks
								associated with companies or individuals prior to a new
								engagement. Research uses investigative tools to uncover
								issues of concern, and predominantly focuses on preserving or
								safeguarding integrity and monetary value of a business. As
								such, it is often a report focusing on future risks based on
								past or current information. The information may come from any
								formal or informal source; however, it must be put into
								perspective and triangulated for veracity.
							</p>
							<p>
								Investigations are tailored to the client's needs and can
								focus on a person, company, jurisdiction, or on a specific
								question of the client. For example, it may solely cover ESG
								issues, such as any potential harms of a company's plant to
								the environment and/or local communities or any issues of
								concern with its supply chain. When investigating a person,
								their track record, controversial connections and reputation
								could be investigated, including any ongoing probes.
							</p>
							<p>
								The types of investigations vary as much as the clients. As
								there is such a wide variety of questions and objectives,
								methodologies of obtaining information demand creativity
								(within legal perimeters) of an investigation.
							</p>
							<strong>
								<ol start="2">
									<li class="pb-1 pt-1">
										What does an investigation entail?
									</li>
								</ol>
							</strong>
							<p>
								So, where does an investigation begin? It starts by verifying
								and gathering snippets of information of the client. We then
								try to establish a footprint of the company or individual, and
								aim at finding if there are any proxies, family members,
								business associates, corporate interests, or other
								jurisdictions that need to be covered in order to answer the
								client's question.
							</p>
							<p>
								References found on the internet provide an excellent source
								to map out these interests, relationships, and former
								residencies. Many investigations may only use online sources
								and will often be successful in providing a comprehensive
								answer to the client's concern. For example, connections of a
								LinkedIn profile can verify studies or former employer and
								reports filed on environmental agencies' websites can disclose
								pollution issues of a company.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, there is a significant amount of information is not
								directly available online and obtaining such information
								requires an investigator's inventiveness. For example, an
								investigation into a chemical storage unit may require a site
								visit or enquiries at the local community about any current or
								past environmental damage. In contrast, if we want to check a
								proposed investment's track record, discreet enquiries with
								former employees, industry journalists or competitors may be
								required to address questions on adherence to internal quality
								standards. In addition, an investigator may need various IT
								skills such as programming, knowledge of local databases or
								data analytics.
							</p>
							<p>
								Although creativity is key to an investigator's skillset,
								knowledge of limitations is as relevant. A due diligence
								investigation must be conducted within legal perimeters, to
								not defeat its own purpose. As such, an investigator must know
								local, national and supranational data protection regulations.
								For example, when information is missing from a country's
								corporate register, there is a good chance another country's
								corporate register can disclose exactly that piece of
								information, e.g. Luxembourg's UBO register is relatively
								comprehensive in contrast to that of the Netherlands. A great
								investigator knows how to gather all relevant pieces of the
								puzzle within legal limitations, to create a complete picture
								of its subject while complying with law.
							</p>
							<strong>
								<ol start="3">
									<li class="pb-1 pt-1">
										How is this relevant for ethics and compliance?
									</li>
								</ol>
							</strong>
							<p>
								Individuals and the wider
								<strong>society</strong> increasingly demand adherence to
								<strong>ethical standards</strong>. Take the example of
								international banks, which, after several data leaks
								accompanied by public scrutiny, increased their efforts to
								investigate clients suspected of being involved in
								<a target="_blank"
									href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-secrets-leak-unmasks-criminals-fraudsters-corrupt-politicians"
									class="external-link">serious crimes</a>. Moreover, if a person or company
								disregards ethical
								standards, social media and online media outlets allow anyone
								to scrutinise a person or company, and exponentially disperse
								their opinions. As such, a deep dive into your future
								counterparties is much needed to safeguard your own integrity
								and that of your business.
							</p>
							<p>
								Beyond reputational issues, an in-depth investigative due
								diligence may also protect and improve a
								<strong>business's financial performance</strong>. It would
								reduce the risk of future probes, government fines and
								litigation. Checking for a company's corporate culture ensures
								that a new partnership of joint venture is not bogged down by
								inefficiency or a toxic corporate culture. Having a track
								record of in-depth checks into your counterparties may also
								make your company more attractive for future

									partners or investors.</a>
							</p>
							<strong>
								<ol start="4">
									<li class="pb-1 pt-1">
										An example of failing due diligence
									</li>
								</ol>
							</strong>
							<p>
								On 28 October 2021, the Dutch bank ING announced that it would
								start phasing out services of its payment service provided
								<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ing.com/Newsroom/News/ING-phases-out-Payvision.htm"
									class="external-link">Payvision</a>. The bank had acquired the platform for USD 420m
								in 2018.
								Various news reports on this decision emerged in November
								2021, stating that ING was closing down PayVision as the
								company was under investigation for processing payments that
								resulted from illegal investment schemes, including online
								pornography and gambling customers, which was against ING's
								own
								<a target="_blank"
									href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ing-payments-payvision-idUKL8N2HZ4QW"
									class="external-link">
									policy</a>. Reportedly, ING sold PayVision back to its founders for USD
								1.20 - taking millions of dollars in losses.
							</p>
							<p>
								Such an example shows how a lack of investigation in a
								company's connections, clients, growth pattern and industry
								reputation may damage a future partner's business. Key
								questions that should have been tackled prior to acquisition
								is what the client's own ethical standards are; what client
								base PayVision had; how it had developed its business and what
								its corporate connections were.
							</p>
							<p>
								In summary, we live in a time when societies increasingly
								demand disclosure of operations and adherence to ethical
								standards. Companies need to realise that they cannot ignore
								such demands and so formulate their business model accordingly
								to safeguard their reputation and value.
							</p>
							<p>
								Business intelligence investigations are tailored to help
								businesses comply with these increasing demands. An
								investigator always need to act within the limits of law yet a
								creative approach always helps to go beyond regular due
								diligence reports' findings.
