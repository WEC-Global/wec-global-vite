                                On 10 July 2022, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published a
                                detailed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/"
                                    class="external-link">report</a> on Uber's unethical and unlawful operations in
                                Europe between 2013 and 2017. It contains icky details on how the tech giant used
                                gorilla methods to grow, got access to high-level politicians at the national and
                                European Union level to avoid compliance with the law, and hid data from law enforcement
                                during raids. Uber has not
                                only destroyed the livelihood of many taxi drivers, but it ruthlessly disregarded the
                                regulatory environment and court rulings, which led to its infamous business model of “
                                move fast and break things.” As the expansion methods were rather aggressive and not
                                regulated then, Uber needed European politicians' support to bend national laws to their
                                advantage. And some of the politicians did not have a problem with it.

                                The Uber files is a perfect example of failed personal integrities, showing how much
                                work needs to be done by compliance and ethics professionals to improve the system.

                                Uber's business model was not regulated in many European countries when it was launched.
                                The company plunged into markets in a regulatory vacuum without government approvals,
                                making Uber's drivers the target of traditional cabbies' rage. Taxi drivers saw their
                                business threatened by competitors who didn't have to play by the same rules. This
                                created outrage among taxi drivers and triggered many protests around Europe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In many cases, Uber turned this to its advantage, tried to paint a bad picture about the
                                taxi drivers, and voiced it in the media. When it went all too far, or as they called
                                the “pyramid of shits,” Uber needed support. Thus, high-lobbying activity began to find
                                ways of avoiding legal consequences and continuing operation and expansion.

                                Lobbying as such is not illegal yet can be unethical. When government officials receive
                                discounts on Uber rides, are invited to luxurious lunches, are provided with advice
                                about jobs, or free political campaign work, it is questionable how such activity can be
                                seen as ethical or transparent. The response to such lobbying activity raises the
                                question of the moral compass of many public officials, according to the report.
                            </p>

                                During these years, Uber lobbyists were the best-paid employees in the company, and not
                                without reason. They did their job well by building a relationship with high-level
                                politicians and convincing them about the economic value of Uber in the given country.
                                To get things moving quicker, the CEO of Uber descended to Davos during the World
                                Economic Forum in 2016 to strike deals with world leaders and oligarchs. They were
                                winning support from many sides. Yet, protests continued, and law enforcement appeared
                                in Uber's offices.

                                Uber was not shy to use stealth technology to thwart government investigations and to
                                hide company data. The so-called 'kill switch' cut access to company servers and
                                prevented authorities from seizing evidence during raids on Uber offices. This was used
                                during the raids in Amsterdam in 2015 and Paris in 2014, ordered by the higher
                                management. Uber created an internal document on how to deal with situations when law
                                enforcement, auditors, and inspectors arrive. The manual, called Dawn Raid Manual,
                                contained 2600 words and included instructions like “Move the Regulators into a meeting
                                room that does not contain any files or access to internal IT system” and “Remain calm,
                                be friendly, and take time to think.”

                                Meanwhile, Uber was never charged with obstruction of justice, and the company argues
                                that it shut down machines so the investigators could see only what they needed. While
                                protection of personal data and business information is indeed essential, as one Dutch
                                expert <a target="_blank"

                                being requested, a company may no longer intervene by making them inaccessible.”
                                Otherwise, it is indeed the obstruction of justice.

                                Uber's lobbying activity was successful even at the European Union level. Neelie Kroes,
                                a former Dutch transportation minister who served as vice president of the European
                                Commission, the European Union's executive arm, was receptive to helping Uber whenever
                                she could. According to the report, she used her influence to press a Dutch minister and
                                other members of the government “to force regulator and police to back off” from an
                                investigation of Uber's Amsterdam office. This was all done while she was an EU
                                commissioner. About a year after leaving the EU Commission in October 2014, Kroes asked
                                to be allowed to join a paid Uber advisory board, despite an 18-month so-called
                                cooling-off period that forbids former commissioners from lobbying ex-colleagues. The
                                Commission turned her down and denied her appeal. Yet, she did it anyway. Records show
                                Uber offered her $200,000 to chair the board. On top of all, the ethics code of the EU
                                Commission also requires commissioners to “behave in a manner that is in keeping with
                                the dignity and the duties of their office, both during and after their term.” It also
                                requires them to “behave with integrity and discretion … even beyond the 18 months after
                                ceasing to hold office.” This, again, did not seem to be applied to her.

                                This phenomenon, known as the “revolving door,” which has many examples within the
                                institutions of the European Union, received criticism from the European Ombudsman in a
                                press release issued in <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/press-release/en/156070"
                                    class="external-link">May 2022</a>. It pointed out the European Commission's blind
                                eye on the matter.

                                Some believe that all these problems soon will be remedied by the proposed concept of an
                                <a target="_blank"
                                    href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210712IPR08210/independent-ethics-body-improving-transparency-and-integrity-in-eu-institutions"
                                    class="external-link">Independent Ethics Body</a>. This new proposed Body
                                stipulates to use of standardized ethical rules for all EU institutions. Translating
                                this idea at the country level would mean that the same ethical guidelines apply to
                                judges as to the politicians in the government. The idea, however, does not win many
                                supporters amongst the institutions because they argue that their nature, mission, and
                                composition are very different. Nevertheless, the EU Commission plans a meeting to
                                discuss the proposal in September. As EU legislation process can sometimes be
                                burdensome, I hope that the development of this important body will happen sooner than
                                later.
