							<p>
								Whilst my background has involved working across a range of
								industries, from luxury fashion to telecoms, food retail to
								financial service, my focus has consistently been on helping
								people become their best selves at work and able to progress
								in their careers.
							</p>
							<p>
								I’ve worked in different parts of ‘Talent’ for over a decade,
								running development programmes, supporting succession
								planning, coaching high potential future directors, and
								creating a culture of self-directed learning. To set myself up
								for success, I’ve sought out opportunities to get hands on
								experience in new areas, as well as invested in a MSc in
								Organisational Behaviour and a Practitioner Diploma in
								Executive Coaching
							</p>
							<p>
								Culture is something that has always fascinated me. My Masters
								research project was on the impact of ‘Cultural Intelligence’
								in expats moving country with their organisations and their
								performance overseas. This was likely prompted by the fact
								that I was born in Abu Dhabi, grew up in Hong Kong, went to
								university in the UK, and took on a two-year assignment in
								Shanghai, shortly after starting my career.
							</p>
							<p>
								Despite having grown up as an expat due to my parents’ jobs,
								moving to a new country independently where you have basic
								language skills and only know one person (minimally), is still
								a pretty big adventure.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was a bit odd in that I actively wanted to experience
								culture shock and get out of my comfort zone… which is all
								well and good until you remember that this involves feeling,
								well, rather uncomfortable.
							</p>
							<p>
								I remember being determined to meet people and build a life
								for myself that didn’t involve sitting home alone and only
								speaking to other people at work. I discovered ‘Shanghai
								Expats’ as an online community and found meet ups on the
								weekend. The first one I went to, I embraced ‘living like a
								local’ and using the underground rather than ‘cheating’ by
								taking a taxi with the address printed out to show the driver.
							</p>
							<p>
								This was fine until the map by the end the subway was entirely
								in Mandarin characters and I had no idea which exit to take or
								which was the right road to follow. No google maps, I could
								ask for directions but not necessarily understand the response
								and after 45 minutes of wandering around and searching, I
								finally found the right bar and heard English voices. I was so
								relieved!
							</p>
							<p>
								Heading home took a fraction of the time compared to trying to
								find my way in the first place. I also learned a few things. I
								rely heavily on being able to communicate fluently – being
								able to express myself, understand others, and connect through
								language. Not being able to read a map, literally walking in
								circles, it felt like half of my senses were missing.
							</p>
							<p>
								I’m used to being extremely independent and self-reliant.
								Living in Shanghai taught me to accept (and even seek out) the
								help of others. Especially when it comes to getting the basics
								sorted, like learning how to recognise what bills look like
								and how you pay them (no direct debits there!), how to set up
								a bank account and how to deal with problems in my flat. Yes,
								when there was a leak, I was able to find someone in the
								management office and gesture with my hands and say “shui,
								shui!” (“water, water!”) with urgency and explain where I
								lived so they came to investigate, but having an estate agent
								liaise with my landlord over a broken aircon and translate
								between us was a godsend.
							</p>
							<p>
								Feeling lost and struggling to navigate an unfamiliar
								environment can knock your confidence. There were times when I
								felt stupid. I couldn’t understand what was going on around me
								and you realise what assumptions you have when they are
								tested.
							</p>
							<p>
								For anyone considering embarking on an overseas adventure, I
								would whole-heartedly recommend it. Obviously, everyone’s
								situation is different and you need to decide for yourself if
								it’s the right thing for you, but it’s the most incredible
								learning opportunity.
							</p>
							<p>
								I learned to slow down and think about how else I could
								express myself. I learned that I could talk to strangers and
								make friends in random places, like the taxi line outside the
								Hilton hotel. I learned that I am more resilient than I’d ever
								realised AND that there’s real strength in a supportive
								community. I learned the importance of keeping perspective and
								questioning how realistic my expectations were when I
								encountered challenges. I also learned that I need to create
								my own boundaries with work and with friends, to decide what
								was and wasn’t OK and reasonable.
							</p>
							<p>
								By the end of my two years in Shanghai I had gone from very
								rusty Mandarin (10 years' since studying it in school,
								pre-GCSE) to being able to have stilted conversations with
								taxi drivers who talked about their daughter's playing guitar,
								or feeling pretty confident in restaurants speaking to the
								staff. I had decent 'holiday' Mandarin and had worked with a
								tutor to be able to deliver the basics of our company
								Onboarding presentation in Chinese but was still pretty far
								from being fluent. Sadly most of my language skills have faded
								since I've returned to the UK, you really do need to use it or
								lose it.
							</p>
							<p>
								I feel lucky that I was able to create a new home for myself
								there, which was very much dependent on finding the right
								group of friends and creating our own family together. Having
								people that you see multiple times a week and establishing a
								new routine with early morning bootcamps all helped. It became
								an extra home, rather than a replacement for the UK where my
								family were, and it was still hard to say goodbye when I came
								back to visit.
							</p>
							<p>
								If I could offer advice to those taking the plunge to move
								overseas:
							</p>
							<ul style="
										list-style-position: inside;
										padding-bottom: 1.4rem;
										text-align: left;
									">
								<li>
									Go and try all the things you want to do, even if you have
									no one else to do them with (yet).
								</li>
								<li>
									Make it a priority to meet people and find your tribe. They
									are out there, and together, you create belonging.
								</li>
								<li>
									Pay it forward to anyone joining after you and show them the
									ropes.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger
									self?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s absolutely fine to change your mind about what you want
								to do in your career. Find out as much as you can about an
								area you think you’re interested in. When you find something
								that you love learning more about, and actually doing, not
								just the ‘idea’ of the job – make a plan and go for it!
							</p>

							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
									be doing now?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								Related field – on my way to becoming a Professor of
								Organisational Behaviour at London Business School.
							</p>
							<p>
								Completely different – running a quirky bookshop/cafe in the
								Cotswolds that somehow makes enough money to keep on going!
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>At the end of your career if you were to sit and reflect,
									what one hope do you have?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I hope to have no regrets in wishing I’d pursued an
								opportunity but instead held myself back. I’d rather go after
								what I want and learn from the full experience than play it
								safe and wonder, "what if?".
