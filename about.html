							<p>
								Early 2021, a few wonderful women, from different parts of the
								world, came together to build something special. We, as women in
								the fields of ethics and compliance, wanted to create a trusted
								circle of inspiring women celebrating the essence of all that is
								best for professional women.
							</p>
							<p>
								Each of the founding members of WEC Global has achieved
								something unique in her own life and, by coming together, we
								knew we could achieve something even greater. Using digital
								technology in creative ways, we aspire to create an invaluable
								network of peers, learning, and career-building without borders
								and biases.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through professional, social, and personal growth opportunities,
								we are here to support you at every step of your journey. Our
								aim is to encourage a mutually collaborative spirit to nurture
								and support the success and fulfillment of each individual by
								providing a unique platform to connect and collaborate freely.
								We are able to do this through a private online community,
								personal one-to-one introductions, mentorship programs, writing
								opportunities, and exclusive events hosted by WEC Global and our
								members.
							</p>
							<p>
								We pride ourselves on being an inclusive, rather than exclusive,
								organization. Whatever part of the world you come from or
								skillset within ethics and compliance you hold, you are welcome
								to apply. Men are also absolutely welcome to join as a friend of
								WEC Global. We welcome you to stand firm with us as we globally
								unite in compliance and ethics.
