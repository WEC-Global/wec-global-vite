									The profession of "compliance" has transformed so quickly and
									so fundamentally in the last twenty years, it’s almost
									unrecognizable. What started out as mostly accountants, then
									lawyers, is now a glorious potpourri of people with diverse
									skills and backgrounds. Effective compliance programs are
									maturing to integrate the unique skills of learning
									specialists, project managers, process designers, auditors,
									communications experts, investigators, analysts, data
									scientists, culture experts, and more. As compliance becomes
									more and more recognized as a critical foundation for business
									success and simultaneously recognized for its incredible
									complexity, the diversity of talent required to do it well has
									evolved at pace.
								</p>
								<p>
									In today’s compliance profession, a wealth of opportunities
									exist for those starting out and those interested in making a
									mid-career pivot. Whether you’re just starting out or have
									years of experience under your belt in another field, give
									compliance a careful look. Today’s compliance programs require
									a variety of skills and experience that address the
									ever-growing complexity of:
								</p>

								<ul
									style="
										list-style-position: inside;
										padding-bottom: 1.4rem;
										text-align: left;
									"
								>
									<li>
										day-to-day business operations across an array of functions
										(e.g., sales, marketing, order fulfillment, billing, 3rd
										party relationships, finance, manufacturing, development,
										and so on);
									</li>
									<li>
										the incomprehensibly vast amount of data expected to be
										synthesized into meaningful risk information;
									</li>
									<li>
										the ways a multi-generational workforce learns and retains
										information; and
									</li>
									<li>
										emerging technologies and social paradigms we have yet to
										even integrate into our thinking.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									<strong>Built-in vs. bolt-on</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									One of the fundamental shifts of the last two decades has been
									the recognition that built-in compliance controls tend to be
									more effective than their bolt-on equivalents. System and
									process controls, including “real-time” training reminders,
									built directly in to operational processes have a much higher
									chance of success. But to work, those controls have to be
									designed well and integrate seamlessly into the work. Gone are
									the days of standalone approval processes or screening
									controls that exist over there. Whether the work is within
									marketing, sales, or finance, real-world experience in those
									processes is essential to designing and implementing an
									effective control. Who better than someone who has done that
									work for ten years to design ways to close gaps, install
									gates, or spot opportunities for a pop-up reminder? If you
									have broad and deep experience in the day-to-day operations in
									an industry or within a company, you’re an ideal candidate for
									a compliance team looking for ways to build in control
									mechanisms. If you’re just starting out in your career and
									able to look at a process end to end to find gaps, ideate
									better ways of accomplishing outcomes, and water-test seals to
									find leaks (ways people could accomplish bad things), you are
									also an ideal candidate for a compliance career. Compliance
									programs need people who know every nook and cranny of their
									complex ERP system, but also people with fresh eyes who
									understand the massive and constant changes to the technology.
									It can often take the combination of the very experienced and
									the new to the field employees to find the best solution to
									complex regulatory changes, emerging risks, and creative
									innovations in criminal thinking.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Data is King… and also the court jester</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Not only do regulators expect companies to use the data they
									have to spot red flags and make sound decisions, they expect
									compliance programs to use data in very broad and very narrow
									ways. Compliance programs today have to use incredibly complex
									and constantly changing data sets to perform both strategic
									and precision decision-making. And they need people who can
									understand the data, the systems used to create and report the
									data, and the machine learning opportunities that can help
									interpret the data.
								</p>
								<p>
									It’s impossible in today’s data-age for a mere mortal to
									capture, understand, analyze and synthesize the vast amounts
									of data created in our business operations. We not only need
									computers to store the data, but we now rely on computers to
									make sense of it for us. So, more than ever, we need data
									scientists and computer programmers that can help us create
									computer algorithms that turn data into meaningful
									information.
								</p>
								<p>
									I can’t even count the number of investigations I’ve worked on
									that started with a nefarious outcome we traced directly back
									to warning signs in data that would have helped us prevent the
									bad act, if only someone had seen the warning flag flapping in
									the breeze. I like to describe our current wealth of data as a
									blizzard – a white-out condition, high winds, power lines may
									go down, blizzard. We have so much data that we have trouble
									seeing any one particular snow drift, let alone individual
									snowflakes. We’re all doing our best to keep the car on the
									road and stay aware of new squalls and that’s about the best
									most of us can hope for. I could pause here to cite some
									incomprehensible statistic about the volume of data created
									every nanosecond, but it would probably be outdated by the
									time I get to the next paragraph. There are two big ways this
									data blizzard presents opportunities and risk. The
									opportunities are endless – imagine how powerful it would be
									to use your company data to spot risk trends, develop targeted
									thresholds for process controls, prioritize compliance
									investments and escalations, and be able to show the C-Suite
									their risks in impactful, company-specific data stories. But,
									beyond the positive ways mastering data can help compliance be
									more effective, the reality is that when not utilized well, it
									creates big risk, too. Enforcement authorities almost always
									view data through the narrow lens of the investigation at hand
									and that can lead to somewhat unrealistic expectations about
									what a company should have (or I’d argue even could have) done
									with it. As they pull on the thread of an allegation, there is
									almost always some data in some system somewhere that could’ve
									warned you this was happening if only you’d looked. And
									suddenly your “isolated bad actor” defense gets a lot less
									effective. If you’re someone steeped in the collection,
									management, and dissection of data – compliance needs you. If
									you’re someone highly capable of understanding and
									capitalizing on the power of artificial intelligence and
									machine learning, compliance needs you.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Look at this shiny thing over here</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Just like in our personal lives, employees are inundated with
									too much information, too many “urgent” things, and too much
									noise. And generally, employees either consciously or
									subconsciously sort through that noise and focus on the
									imperatives – a sort of mental Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.
									So, how do we get crucial compliance messaging to break
									through and get mapped to that lower tier of the mental
									pyramid? To make matters more complex, we’ve also never had
									such a huge range of workers spanning significant generational
									and learning-style differences. We can’t just focus on getting
									employees to notice us waving a shiny object, we need them to
									actually understand and contemplate what’s written on it or
									coming from its loud-speakers. There is an entire profession
									around adult learning and retention that’s become more complex
									and more crucial as the social media, 24x7 consumption,
									sophisticated multi-channel communication capabilities have
									become mainstream. I liken it to juries conditioned with years
									of CSI style TV shows having a hard time getting to a guilty
									verdict without some hardcore forensic data from the
									prosecutors. Realistic or not, we’ve all been quietly
									conditioned to expect DNA, hair and fiber analysis and exotic
									insect larvae as standard course in a criminal case. The same
									is true for corporate communications. We are all so used to
									dynamic videos, flashy ads, adorable puppies, and creative
									social media marketing techniques that we have become quietly
									conditioned to expect that in everything we do. A boring email
									reminding us to get approval before we take that public sector
									official to lunch? No way… I will need a Buzzfeed-style 6
									Reasons Why I Should Care video journal with animated avatars
									and a catchy song playing before I even consider clicking on
									it. Between Maslow’s Hierarchy and our information-absorption
									conditioning, compliance needs experts who know how to
									communicate in a way that catches, keeps and inspires
									attention.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong
										>Emerging social and ethical paradigms we haven’t even
										thought of yet</strong
									>
								</p>
								<p>
									As technologies evolve, new kinds of ethical dilemmas are
									emerging. As social justice and employee and consumer activism
									take root, new ways of identifying and aligning to an ethical
									code are becoming more critical. 3D printing brought new
									challenges for companies to decide whether to try to prevent
									their technology from being used to print weapons. Bad
									behavior of the ultra-wealthy and outspoken social activists
									have forced non-profits and giving platforms to reconsider
									whether they want their money and where and how to draw the
									moral lines. Advances and harmful biases in artificial
									intelligence have forced law enforcement agencies to struggle
									with when and how to use the powerful tool. Since a whole
									generation of those under 25 grows up knowing how to code now,
									tech companies are regularly facing conflicts of interest
									questions related to employees who design apps on the side.
									Ethical issues that we hadn’t even thought of ten years ago
									are now mainstream dilemmas. Whether to require employees or
									customers to wear masks, disclose vaccine status, or come back
									to the office is now a topic in most leadership meetings. Loud
									and impactful examples of consumer and employee activism
									permeate our newsfeed. There is no shortage of new and
									difficult dilemmas companies have to tackle and often the
									compliance function is seen as a key arbiter, influencer and
									subject-matter expert. If you’re an ethicist, a researcher, a
									student of cultural-social-justice movements, a seeker of
									global perspectives, and willing to challenge your own views,
									compliance needs you.
								</p>
								<p>
									These are just a few examples of the ways the compliance
									profession has expanded and will continue to evolve alongside
									technological, ethical, and societal changes. What are some
									other professions, skill sets, and capabilities you’re seeing
