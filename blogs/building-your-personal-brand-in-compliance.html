								Every time I interview a professional for placement in my
								compliance team, the first question I ask is 'tell me about
								yourself'. This allows the candidate to speak in an open
								format, and a chance to present an elevator pitch about
								himself/herself. But almost every candidate speaks about
								his/her work experience on all the projects and assignments
								during their career in a chronological order! Yes, that gives
								me a summation of their assignments and work experiences, but
								what is it that differentiates one candidate from another with
								similar profiles? Does he/she have a USP that describes who
								he/she is and what he/she can be valued for, his/her
								strengths, interests, capabilities and so on that makes
								him/her a stronger fit for the role?
							</p>
							<p>
								In today's world, personal branding has grown extremely
								significant, both within one's organization as well as
								externally in the global community. It helps in career
								progression, gaining visibility and finding new opportunities
								in employment or business. As I groom Compliance professionals
								in the art of self-branding, here are my top 5 tips on how you
								can build yours:
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Decide on your personal brand</strong> - I have been
								working in banking compliance for over 2 decades now, and
								early in my career my goal was to rise the corporate ladder,
								just like anyone else. But after spending 15 years in the
								industry, my mindset changed from career growth to finding a
								purpose and adding value through my work. That is when I
								decided to focus on my niche - financial crimes compliance -
								and work in this area both internally (within my organization)
								and externally (in the global community). I can see now that
								my brand has developed as an industry leader in this very
								space! Ethics and compliance is a very broad and deep domain,
								so it helps if you narrow down to your own area of expertise
								or interest/aspiration, aligning with what you wish to
								accomplish professionally, and work on developing your brand
								in that focus area.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Stand out through your profile</strong> - Whether it
								is your job resume or social media profile, create your own
								USP that differentiates you from your peers and positions you
								in a premium bracket. In the digital world we live in now, a
								curated social media presence aligning with your chosen focus
								area consistently across multiple platforms can reinforce your
								brand. Your introductions and activities in all these profiles
								must speak about your area of expertise/passion, specific work
								you have done in this field, certifications and publications.
								I generally suggest a 100-word headline in a resume which
								doubles up as your elevator pitch and sets the perception
								about your brand.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Build a Compliance Network</strong> - 'A man is known
								by the company he keeps' is an age old proverb. If you are
								interested in anti-bribery investigation, for example, network
								with professionals in anti-bribery & corruption (ABC), join
								related compliance groups and forums, attend events on this
								subject (most webinars are complimentary), follow ABC leaders
								and industry influencers. Asking questions, sharing ideas or
								just being visible in ABC circles will not only strengthen
								your knowledge and resources in this area, but also build your
								credibility as an ABC professional/expert. Women in Ethics &
								Compliance is one such forum which has a galaxy of compliance
								professionals as well as aspirants - undoubtedly a great
								platform to share ideas and grow as a compliance expert!
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Thought Leadership</strong> - Compliance is a very
								dynamic area with rapid changes in Regulations, technology,
								operating models and so on. Sharing your point of view, e.g.
								publishing an analysis of a new Regulation, posting your
								opinion on a news report that can have an impact on
								compliance, talking about an industry challenge and what
								model/innovative process or tool can resolve it and so on
								within your compliance community networks can elevate your
								brand as an original thinker and thought leader. I consciously
								practice this through my dedicated Compliance column in
								'Corporate Compliance Insights', articles in reputed journals
								and social media posts, which brought me a lot of visibility
								and led to my speaking engagements in global compliance
								conferences.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Mentor aspiring compliance professionals</strong> -
								Compliance is an area which has assumed immense significance,
								and the role of compliance professionals has grown to be a
								very niche one, which is in high demand but low supply.
								Enabling our current and future workforce, mentoring and
								skilling them in this impactful role can strongly enhance
								one's brand. I have been actively mentoring aspiring
								professionals and university students interested in a career
								in compliance, e.g. through sessions to students of IE
								University (Madrid), to current and aspiring AML professionals
								in TCAE (Toronto Compliance & AML Events), in addition to
								running a FCC forum within my organization. This has not only
								increased my follower base, but also reinforced my brand as an
								FCC leader.
							</p>
							<p>
								Building one's brand takes time and conscious effort, but I
								can vouch for the fact that it is worth it! It is not enough
								to know your business, it is equally important to let the
								world know precisely what value you bring, what are your
								unique strengths/traits that make you stronger than your peers
								- that is what sets you apart and makes you a recognized
								leader in your field! With Ethics & Compliance being among the
								top agenda of CXOs across industries today, the time is right
								for Compliance professionals to build their personal brand in
								this space - this is certainly one step to propel your
								business/career!

								<strong>What is one piece of advice you would give to your younger
									self?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								There was a period in my career when I refused travel based
								work assignments, to focus on my personal life in my home
								country, India. But in my career of over 2 decades, I have
								learnt - and would advise my younger self, that every
								opportunity life gives must be taken up, whether personal or
								professional. One need not be paused to focus on the other, as
								every experience enriches us in ways we can never fathom!
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you had to choose an alternative career, what would you
									be doing now?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I have always been interested in academics and wanted to teach
								in a University or Management School as a career when I was
								growing up. I have had a long, successful corporate stint, but
								Academics is my passion!
							</p>
							<p class="pb-0">
								<strong>If you were to sit and reflect at the end of your career,
									what one hope do you have?</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
								I hope to have made a difference, howsoever small, that has
								helped human lives and society through my efforts in fighting
								financial crimes, contributing to the industry/community by
								spreading awareness, new ideas and innovations and mentoring
								the next generation in this global combat!
